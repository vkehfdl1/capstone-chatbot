            Semantic Masking is a technique to improve the end-to-end models in speech recognition, which can be used to improve the accuracy of the end-to-end models. By restricting the attention mechanism in the Transformer, it is able to improve the accuracy of the end-to-end model by enforcing the model to attend to the correct words in the sequence.

            The original Transformer has a limitation in that it is not able to learn long-distance dependencies in the sequence, as it only takes the last few words in the sequence as context to make the prediction. By proposing an alternative attention mechanism, Semantic Masking is able to improve the accuracy of the end-to-end model by forcing the model to attend to the correct words in the sequence.

            The transformation from a sequence of words to a sequence of acoustic features is achieved by a neural network. The network takes a sequence of words as input and outputs a sequence of acoustic features. The network is trained with a large dataset of audio recordings of people speaking the words in the training set. The network learns the mapping from the input words to the output acoustic features.

Comparing with hybrid methods, our model obtains a similar performance on the test-clean set, but is still worse than the best hybrid model on the test-other dataset.', 'End-to-end (E2E) acoustic models, particularly with the attention-based encoder-decoder framework BIBREF0, have achieved a competitive recognition accuracy in a wide range of speech datasets BIBREF1. This model directly learns the mapping from the input acoustic signals to the output transcriptions without decomposing the problems into several different modules such as lexicon modeling, acoustic modeling and language modeling as in the conventional hybrid architecture. While this kind of E2E approach significantly simplifies the speech recognition pipeline, the weakness is that it is difficult to tune the strength of each component. One particular problem from our observations is that the attention based E2E model tends to make grammatical errors, which indicates that the language modeling power of the model is weak, possibly due to the small amount of training data, or the mismatch between the training and evaluation data. However, due to the jointly model approach in the attention model, it is unclear how to improve the strength of the language modeling power, i.e., attributing more weights to the previous output tokens in the decoder, or to improve the strength of the acoustic modeling power, i.e., attributing more weights to the context vector from the encoder.', 'In principle, our approach is applicable to the attention-based E2E framework with any type of neural network encoder. To constrain our research scope, we focus on the transformer architecture BIBREF5, which is originally proposed for neural machine translation. Recently, it has been shown that the transformer model can achieve competitive or even higher recognition accuracy compared with the recurrent neural network (RNN) based E2E model for speech recognition BIBREF6. Compared with RNNs, the transformer model can capture the long-term correlations with a computational complexity of $O(1)$, instead of using many steps of back-propagation through time (BPTT) as in RNNs. We evaluate our transformer model with semantic masking on Librispeech and TedLium datasets. We show that semantic masking can achieve significant word error rate reduction (WER) on top of SpecAugment, and we report the lowest WERs on the test sets of the Librispeech corpus with an E2E model.', 'We evaluate our model in different settings. The baseline Transformer represents the model with position embedding. The comparison between baseline Transformer and our architecture (Model with SpecAugment) indicates the improvements attributed to the architecture. Model with semantic mask is we use the semantic mask strategy on top of SpecAugment, which outperforms Model with SpecAugment with a large margin in a no external language model fusion setting, demonstrating that our masking strategy helps the E2E model to learn a better language model. The gap becomes smaller when equipped with a language model fusion component, which further confirms our motivation in Section SECREF1. Speed Perturbation does not help model performance on the clean dataset, but it is effective on the test-other dataset. Rescore is beneficial to both test-clean and test-other datasets.', 'This paper presents a semantic mask method for E2E speech recognition, which is able to train a model to better consider the whole audio context for the disambiguation.

SentRewrite BIBREF26 and InconsisLoss BIBREF25 all try to decompose the word by word summary generation into sentence selection from document and “sentence” level summarization (or compression). Bottom-Up BIBREF27 generates summaries by combines a word prediction model with the decoder attention model. The extractive models are usually based on hierarchical encoders (SummaRuNNer; BIBREF3 and NeuSum; BIBREF11 ). They have been extended with reinforcement learning (Refresh; BIBREF4 and BanditSum; BIBREF20 ), Maximal Marginal Relevance (NeuSum-MMR; BIBREF21 ), latent variable modeling (LatentSum; BIBREF5 ) and syntactic compression (JECS; BIBREF38 ). Lead3 is a baseline which simply selects the first three sentences. Our model $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_S$ (in-domain), which only use one pre-training stage on the in-domain CNNDM training set, outperforms all of them and differences between them are all significant with a 0.95 confidence interval (estimated with the ROUGE script). Note that pre-training $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_S$ (in-domain) is very fast and it only takes around 30 minutes for one epoch on the CNNDM training set.

            Question: Is the baseline a non-heirarchical model like BERT?

            Answer:
            1. BERT is a non-heirarchical model, but Hibert's encoder is hierarchical.
            2. The human reference is the best, but Hibert is about equal to the human reference.

            Hibert is a text encoding model, which is used to create a sentence embedding.

            Given a sentence, the model will output a vector, which is then used to generate a summary.

            Hibert uses a neural encoder to encode a sentence.

            The neural encoder is hierarchical.

            The neural encoder is similar to BERT, which is also a neural encoder.

            BERT is a non-hierarchical model.

            BERT is usually used with a neural decoder.

Pointer+Coverage BIBREF9 , Abstract-ML+RL BIBREF10 and DCA BIBREF42 are all sequence to sequence learning based models with copy and coverage modeling, reinforcement learning and deep communicating agents extensions. SentRewrite BIBREF26 and InconsisLoss BIBREF25 all try to decompose the word by word summary generation into sentence selection from document and “sentence” level summarization (or compression). Bottom-Up BIBREF27 generates summaries by combines a word prediction model with the decoder attention model. The extractive models are usually based on hierarchical encoders (SummaRuNNer; BIBREF3 and NeuSum; BIBREF11 ). They have been extended with reinforcement learning (Refresh; BIBREF4 and BanditSum; BIBREF20 ), Maximal Marginal Relevance (NeuSum-MMR; BIBREF21 ), latent variable modeling (LatentSum; BIBREF5 ) and syntactic compression (JECS; BIBREF38 ). Lead3 is a baseline which simply selects the first three sentences. Our model $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_S$ (in-domain), which only use one pre-training stage on the in-domain CNNDM training set, outperforms all of them and differences between them are all significant with a 0.95 confidence interval (estimated with the ROUGE script).

Our models with two pre-training stages ( $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_S$ ) or larger size ( $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_M$ ) perform even better and $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_M$ outperforms BERT by 0.5 ROUGE. We also implemented two baselines. One is the hierarchical transformer summarization model (HeriTransfomer; described in ""Extractive Summarization"" ) without pre-training. Note the setting for HeriTransfomer is ( $L=4$ , $H=300$ and $A=4$ ) . We can see that the pre-training (details in Section ""Pre-training"" ) leads to a +1.25 ROUGE improvement.

Now we have finished the encoding of a document with a hierarchical bidirectional transformer encoder Hibert. Note that in previous work, document representation are also learned with hierarchical models, but each hierarchy is a Recurrent Neural Network BIBREF3 , BIBREF21 or Convolutional Neural Network BIBREF11 . We choose the Transformer because it outperforms CNN and RNN in machine translation BIBREF6 , semantic role labeling BIBREF32 and other NLP tasks BIBREF0 . In the next section we will introduce how we train Hibert with an unsupervised training objective.', 'However, extractive models require sentence level labels, which are usually not included in most summarization datasets (most datasets only contain document-summary pairs). Sentence labels are usually obtained by rule-based methods (e.g., maximizing the ROUGE score between a set of sentences and reference summaries) and may not be accurate. Extractive models proposed recently BIBREF11 , BIBREF3 employ hierarchical document encoders and even have neural decoders, which are complex. Training such complex neural models with inaccurate binary labels is challenging. We observed in our initial experiments on one of our dataset that our extractive model (see Section ""Extractive Summarization"" for details) overfits to the training set quickly after the second epoch, which indicates the training set may not be fully utilized. Inspired by the recent pre-training work in natural language processing BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF0 , our solution to this problem is to first pre-train the “complex”\' part (i.e., the hierarchical encoder) of the extractive model on unlabeled data and then we learn to classify sentences with our model initialized from the pre-trained encoder. In this paper, we propose Hibert, which stands for HIerachical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We design an unsupervised method to pre-train Hibert for document modeling. We apply the pre-trained Hibert to the task of document summarization and achieve state-of-the-art performance on both the CNN/Dailymail and New York Times dataset.', 'Most recent encoding neural models used in NLP (e.g., RNNs, CNNs or Transformers) can be pre-trained by predicting a word in a sentence (or a text span) using other words within the same sentence (or span). For example, ELMo BIBREF12 and OpenAI-GPT BIBREF13 predict a word using all words on its left (or right); while word2vec BIBREF33 predicts one word with its surrounding words in a fixed window and BERT BIBREF0 predicts (masked) missing words in a sentence given all the other words.', 'We also conducted human experiment with 20 randomly sampled documents from the CNNDM test set. We compared our model $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_M$ against Lead3, DCA, Latent, BERT and the human reference (Human). We asked the subjects to rank the outputs of these systems from best to worst. As shown in Table 4 , the output of $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_M$ is selected as the best in 30% of cases and we obtained lower mean rank than all systems except for Human. We also converted the rank numbers into ratings (rank $i$ to $7-i$ ) and applied student $t$ -test on the ratings. $\\text{\\sc Hibert}_M$ is significantly different from all systems in comparison ( $p < 0.05$ ), which indicates our model still lags behind Human, but is better than all other systems.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1646234676007005,0.2794672194185722,100.00000000000004,0.02580645161290323,0.07611942927323448,1.0,"

Unexpectedly, the performance between models that use the image features and models that do no use these features is not significantly different. As we discussed in Section SECREF1 , this is similar to the issues vqa models faced initially due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset, which leads us to believe that language is a strong prior on the visdial dataset too.

            Our proposed BPE-SSS strategy is a word segmentation strategy for NMT to incorporate the morphological knowledge of agglutinative languages into NMT. As shown in Fig. 10, the proposed method first uses morphological segmentation on morpheme units to obtain the stem units, which contain the morphological information of the words. The stem units are then passed through BPE to obtain the segmentation candidates. The vocabulary size of the segmentation candidates is much smaller than those of the original morpheme units, which helps to reduce the vocabulary size for model training. At the same time, the stem units are still combined into a single unit, which maintains the morphological information and semantic information of the words.
            The proposed BPE-SSS strategy is built upon the segmentation of morpheme units, i.e. a word segmentation strategy that first segments the words into morpheme units and then segments the morpheme units into simple and effective morpheme units.

            We then introduce the morphological segmentation method of Turkish-English and Uyghur-Chinese NMTs.

In this paper, we investigate and compare the following segmentation strategies:', 'In future work, we are planning to incorporate more linguistic and morphology knowledge into the training process of NMT to enhance its capacity of capturing syntactic structure and semantic information on the low-resource and morphologically-rich languages.', 'Bradbury and Socher BIBREF16 employed the modified Morfessor to provide morphology knowledge into word segmentation, but they neglected the morphological varieties between subword units, which might result in ambiguous translation results. Sanchez-Cartagena and Toral BIBREF17 proposed a rule-based morphological word segmentation for Finnish, which applies BPE on all the morpheme units uniformly without distinguishing their inner morphological roles. Huck BIBREF18 explored target-side segmentation method for German, which shows that the cascading of suffix splitting and compound splitting with BPE can achieve better translation results. Ataman et al. BIBREF19 presented a linguistically motivated vocabulary reduction approach for Turkish, which optimizes the segmentation complexity with constraint on the vocabulary based on a category-based hidden markov model (HMM). Our work is closely related to their idea while ours are more simple and realizable. Tawfik et al. BIBREF20 confirmed that there is some advantage from using a high accuracy dialectal segmenter jointly with a language independent word segmentation method like BPE. The main difference is that their approach needs sufficient monolingual data additionally to train a segmentation model while ours do not need any external resources, which is very convenient for word segmentation on the low-resource and morphologically-rich agglutinative languages.', 'In this paper, we investigate morphological segmentation strategies on the low-resource and morphologically-rich languages of Turkish and Uyghur.

Hence, on the analyses of the above popular word segmentation methods, we propose the morphologically motivated segmentation strategy that combines the morpheme segmentation and BPE for further improving the translation performance of NMT.

An automatic sign language recognizer enables an ASL user to translate the sign language to written text or speech, allowing them to communicate with people who are not familiar with ASL. There is a tremendous rise in the popularity of personal digital assistants; available on user's personal and wearable devices (Google Now, Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri, etc.) and also in the form of standalone devices (Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers).

Using video data, it is difficult to extract different body locations and associated motion sequences from a series of RGB frames. Microsoft Kinect is a 3D camera sensor which can use the depth information of a person to capture 3D coordinates of his/her body location across a video.

Unlike traditional image classification or object detection models where neural networks learn hierarchical spatial features from data, sign recognition requires capture of temporal body motion.', 'RNN has shown success in modeling sequential pattern in dataBIBREF6. It can capture temporal dynamics in data by maintaining an internal state. However, the basic RNN has problems dealing with long term dependencies in data due to the vanishing gradient problem BIBREF21. Some solutions to the vanishing gradient problem involve careful initialization of network parameters or early stopping BIBREF22. But the most effective solution is to modify the RNN architecture in such a way that there exists a memory state (cell state) at every time step that can identify what to remember and what to forget. This architecture is referred to as long short term memory (LSTM) network BIBREF23. While the basic RNN is a direct transformation of the previous state and the current input, the LSTM maintains an internal memory and has mechanisms to update and use that memory. This is achieved by deploying four separate neural networks also called gates. Figure FIGREF12 depicts a cell of an LSTM network which shows input at the current time step ${x_t}$ and the previous state ${h_{t-1}}$ enter into the cell; and get concatenated. The forget gate processes it to remove unnecessary information, and outputs ${f_t}$ which gets multiplied with the previously stored memory ${C_{t-1}}$ and produces a refined memory for the current time.', 'Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) is two dimensional in which each layer has a stack of 2D feature maps generated from previous layer or from inputs in case of first layer. A layer also has a certain numbers of filters which are rectangular patches of parameters. Each filter convolves over the stack of 2D feature maps at previous layer and produces feature maps (equal to the number of filters in the current layer) at current layer. The operation is given by Equation DISPLAY_FORM17 where $F_{i,j}^{l}$ denotes the value of feature map at $l^{th}$ layer at location $(i,j)$. $\\odot $ represents dot product of filter $W$ and associated feature map patch in previous layer.', 'Standard CNN fails to capture the temporal information associated with data, which is important in video or any type of sequential data representation. To solve this problem, 3D convolution was introduced in BIBREF2. The key difference is that kernels are 3D and sub sampling (pooling) layers work across three dimensions.', ""Given a sample skeletal data of $R^{T \\times J \\times 3}$, where $T$ denotes time axis, $J$ is the number of body joints and the last dimension is the 3D coordinates of each joint. We flatten every dimension except time and at each time step we can feed a vector of size $R^{3 \\times J}$ as input. However, we have empirically verified that learning a sequential pattern for each coordinate axis independently and combining them later shows stronger classification performance. Based on this, we trained three different 2 layer LSTMs for data from x, y, and z coordinates separately; and concatenate their final embedding to produce softmax output. In this setting, each separate LSTM receives data as $R^{T \\times J}$ and final embedding size is $R^{3\\times S}$ where $S$ is the state size of LSTM cell. Figure FIGREF15 (a) shows the architecture where as a sample arrives, just before entering into main network, data along separate axis is split and entered into three different LSTM networks. The model concatenates the final state from each of the separate LSTM networks; followed by feeding this into the softmax layer for classification. This approach is referred by Axis Independent Architecture (AI-LSTM). Implementation details such as values of T and J are provided in the `Experiments' section."", ""AI-LSTM, described in last section, works by modeling temporal dynamics of body joints' data over time. However, there can be spatial interactions with joints at a specific time step. It fails to capture any such interaction among joints in a given time. To incorporate spatial relationship among joints, we propose a simple novel data augmentation technique for skeletal data. We do this by origin transfer. For each frame in a gesture sample, we use each wrist joints as origin and transform all other joints' data by subtracting that origin from them. In this way spatial information is added to the input. We refer this model with spatial data augmentation as Spatial AI-LSTM. This augmentation technique is depicted in Figure FIGREF21. A sample data of form $R^{T \\times 6 \\times 3}$ results in a representation of $R^{T \\times 5 \\times 3}$ after subtracting left wrist joint (origin transfer). After this augmentation process, each sample is a $R^{20 \\times 16 \\times 3}$ matrix. Hence, each separate LSTM networks in our Spatial AI-LSTM network receives an input of $R^{20 \\times 16}$."", 'We hypothesize that, some signs that have mostly similar skeletal motion pattern could be distinguishable using hand shape information. We propose a combination of LSTM and 3D CNN networks. We call this Max CNN-LSTM network. Figure FIGREF15 (b) represents the the Max CNN-LSTM. The details of 3D CNN module is shown in Figure FIGREF14. This architecture has two parts: one for left hand patches and other for right hand patches. Each part has four 3D convolutional layers (second and fourth layers have following maximum pooling layers) followed by 2 fully connected layers. Final embeddings from these two parts are concatenated and by using a softmax layer, from which a classification score is produced. The other AI-LSTM network is fed with skeletal time series data. At the final time step, the LSTM state vector is taken and using a softmax layer another probability score is produced. The final classification score is created by taking element wise maximum of the output scores from the two networks. During back–propagation, both networks are trained on their own score. The combined network acts like a model ensemble and some sign classes which are confused by RNN network alone might have an improved recognition accuracy with this approach.', 'To deal with over-fitting, dropout was used for all networks except convolutional layers with probability of 0.5.

We show that pre-ordering the assisting language to match the word order of the source language significantly improves translation quality in an extremely low-resource setting. While the current work focused on Indian languages, we would like to validate the hypothesis on a more diverse set of languages.', 'In this section, we describe the results from our experiments on NMT task. We report the results on X-Hindi pair, where X is one of Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Tamil, and Malayalam. The results are presented in the Table TABREF6 . We report BLEU scores and LeBLEU scores BIBREF30 . We observe that both the pre-ordering configurations significantly improve the BLEU scores over the baseline scores. We observe larger gains when generic pre-ordering rules are used compared to the Hindi-tuned pre-ordering rules.', 'Pre-ordering the source language sentences to match the target language word order has been useful in addressing word-order divergence for Phrase-Based SMT BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 . Recently, BIBREF20 proposed a way to measure and reduce the divergence between the source and target languages based on morphological and syntactic properties, also termed as anisomorphism. They demonstrated that by reducing the anisomorphism between the source and target languages, consistent improvements in NMT performance were obtained. The NMT system used additional features like word forms, POS tags and dependency relations in addition to parallel corpora. On the other hand, BIBREF21 observed a drop in performance due to pre-ordering for NMT. Unlike BIBREF20 , the NMT system was trained on pre-ordered sentences and no additional features were provided to the system. Note that all these works address source-target divergence, not divergence between source languages in multilingual NMT.', 'To address this word order divergence, we propose to pre-order the assisting language sentences to match the word order of the source language. We consider an extremely resource constrained scenario, where we do not have any parallel corpus for the child task. We are limited to a bilingual dictionary for transfer information from the assisting to the source language. From our experiments, we show that there is a significant increase in the translation accuracy for the unseen source-target language pair.', 'Transfer learning has also been explored in the multilingual Neural Machine Translation BIBREF3 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 . The goal is to improve the NMT performance on the source to target language pair (child task) using an assisting source language (assisting to target translation is the parent task). Here, the parent model is trained on the assisting and target language parallel corpus and the trained weights are used to initialize the child model. The child model can now be fine-tuned on the source-target language pairs, if parallel corpus is available. The divergence between the source and the assisting language can adversely impact the benefits obtained from transfer learning. Multiple studies have shown that transfer learning works best when the languages are related BIBREF3 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF9 . Several studies have tried to address lexical divergence between the source and the target languages BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 . However, the effect of word order divergence and its mitigation has not been explored. In a practical setting, it is not uncommon to have source and assisting languages with different word order. For instance, it is possible to find parallel corpora between English and some Indian languages, but very little parallel corpora between Indian languages. Hence, it is natural to use English as an assisting language for inter-Indian language translation.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,100.00000000000004,0.0,0.0,1.0,"

To paint a complete picture of the models' generalization ability we propose a new experimental paradigm in which we independently control for four different variables: the word form's frequency, morphology, the lexeme frequency and the lexeme (a total of 480 experiments). Our comprehensive analysis reveals that BLI models can generalize for frequent morphosyntactic categories, even of infrequent lexemes, but fail to generalize for the more rare categories. This yields a more nuanced picture of the known deficiency of word embeddings to underperform on infrequent words BIBREF6. Our findings also contradict the strong empirical claims made elsewhere in the literature BIBREF4, BIBREF2, BIBREF5, BIBREF7, as we observe that performance severely degrades when the evaluation includes rare morphological variants of a word and infrequent lexemes. We picture this general trend in Figure FIGREF2, which also highlights the skew of existing dictionaries towards more frequent words. As our final contribution, we demonstrate that better encoding of morphology is indeed beneficial: enforcing a simple morphological constraint yields consistent performance improvements for all Romance language pairs and many of the Slavic language pairs.z"", 'Table 4: The results on the standard BLI task and BLI controlled for lexeme for the original Ruder et al.

We observe that the performance degrades when models are evaluated on less common words—even for the infrequent forms of common lexemes. Our results from the controlled for lexeme experiments suggest that models are able to generalize well for more frequent morphosyntactic categories and for part-of-speech with smaller paradigms. However, their ability to generalize decreases as the slots get less frequent and/or the paradigms get larger. Finally, we proposed a simple method to inject morphological knowledge and demonstrated that making models more morphologically aware can lead to general performance improvements."", ""We are, in principle, interested in the ability of the models to generalize morphologically. In the preceding sections we focused on the standard BLI evaluation, which given our objective is somewhat unfair to the models—they are additionally punished for not capturing lexical semantics. To gain more direct insight into the models' generalization abilities we develop a novel experiment in which the lexeme is controlled for. At test time, the BLI model is given a set of candidate translations, all of which belong to the same paradigm, and is asked to select the most suitable form. Note that the model only requires morphological knowledge to successfully complete the task—no lexical semantics is required. When mapping between closely related languages this task is particularly straightforward, and especially so in the case of fastText where a single $n$-gram, e.g. the suffix -ing in English as in the noun running, can be highly indicative of the inflectional morphology of the word.""]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0220994475138121,0.0,100.00000000000004,0.06578947368421054,2.0437622283014227,1.0,"1.

            The lexical features used for emotion cause extraction are based on n-gram and word frequencies. In our paper, we first extract lexical features from Chinese Emotion Cognition Lexicon BIBREF35 and a Chinese news corpus. Then we get 200 features. We calculate the frequency feature of each word in the Chinese Emotion Cognition Lexicon BIBREF35 and then we get 100 frequency features. We calculate the n-gram feature of each word in a Chinese news corpus and then we get 100 n-gram features.

            Question:
            what is the main contribution of the paper?

            Answer:

            We introduce a novel deep memory network for emotion cause extraction. We present a new task of emotion cause extraction as a question answering task. We give a new evaluation metric to evaluate the quality of keywords extracted from the memory network. Our motivation to do this work is to use the semantic information and relation between the emotion word and emotion cause to extract the emotion cause. We achieve 0.5663 F-measure on the test set.

Most of them use linguistic rules or lexicon features, but do not consider the semantic information and ignore the relation between the emotion word and emotion cause. In this paper, we present a new method for emotion cause extraction. We consider emotion cause extraction as a question answering (QA) task. Given a text containing the description of an event which [id=lq]may or may not cause a certain emotion, we take [id=lq]an emotion word [id=lq]in context, such as “sad”, as a query. The question to the QA system is: “Does the described event cause the emotion of sadness?”. The [id=lq]expected answer [id=lq]is either “yes” or “no”. (see Figure FIGREF1 ). We build our QA system based on a deep memory network. The memory network has two inputs: a piece of text, [id=lq]referred to as a story in QA systems, and a query. The [id=lq]story is represented using a sequence of word embeddings.', 'RB+CB+ML (Machine learning method trained from rule-based features and facts from a common-sense knowledge base): This methods was previously proposed for emotion cause classification in BIBREF36 .

Since [id=lq]a memory network models the emotion cause at a fine-grained level, each word has a corresponding weight to measure its importance in this task. Comparing [id=lq]to previous approaches [id=lq]in emotion cause extraction which are [id=lq]mostly based [id=lq]on manually defined rules or linguistic features, [id=lq]a memory network is a more principled way to identify the emotion cause from text. However, the basic [id=lq]memory network model [id=lq]does not capture the sequential information in context which is important in emotion cause extraction.', 'In order to evaluate the quality of keywords extracted by memory networks, we define a new metric on the keyword level of emotion cause extraction.

For Vietnamese language, words and candidate terms can be extracted from Vietnamese copora (such as books, novels, news, and so on) by using a word segmentation tool. Conformed features and context of these words and terms are used to identify named entity tags, topic of documents, or function words. For linguistic analysis, several linguistic features from dictionaries can be used either to annotating POS tags or to identifying the answer sentences. Moreover, language models can be trained by using machine learning approaches and be used in tagging systems, like the named entity recognization system of Tran et al. BIBREF2 .

Given a pair of languages, their word alignment is inherently a bi-directional problem (e.g. English-Italian vs Italian-English). However, most existing research considers mapping from one language to another without making use of symmetry. Our experiments show that separately learned UBLI models are not always consistent in opposite directions. As shown in Figure 1a, when the model of BIBREF11 Conneau18a is applied to English and Italian, the primal model maps the word “three” to the Italian word “tre”, but the dual model maps “tre” to “two” instead of “three”.', 'We compare our method with BIBREF11 (Adv-C) under the same settings. As shown in Table TABREF12, our model outperforms Adv-C on both MUSE and Vecmap for all language pairs (except ES-EN). In addition, the proposed approach is less sensitive to initialization, and thus more stable than Adv-C over multiple runs. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of dual learning. Our method is also superior to Adv-C for the low-resource language pairs English $\\leftrightarrow $ Malay (MS) and English $\\leftrightarrow $ English-Esperanto (EO). Adv-C gives low performances on ES-EN, DE-EN, but much better results on the opposite directions on Vecmap. This is likely because the separate models are highly under-constrained, and thus easy to get stuck in poor local optima. In contrast, our method gives comparable results on both directions for the two languages, thanks to the use of information symmetry.', 'Additionally, we observe that our unsupervised method performs competitively and even better compared with strong supervised and semi-supervised approaches. Ours-Procrustes obtains comparable results with Procrustes on EN-IT and gives strong results on EN-DE, EN-FI, EN-ES and the opposite directions. Ours-GeoMM$_{semi}$ obtains the state-of-the-art results on all tested language pairs except EN-FI, with the additional advantage of being fully unsupervised.', 'Table TABREF15 shows the final results on Vecmap. We first compare our model with the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. Our model based on procrustes (Ours-Procrustes) outperforms Sinkhorn-BT on all test language pairs, and shows better performance than Adv-C-Procrustes on most language pairs. Adv-C-Procrustes gives very low precision on DE-EN, FI-EN and ES-EN, while Ours-Procrustes obtains reasonable results consistently. A possible explanation is that dual learning is helpful for providing good initiations, so that the procrustes solution is not likely to fall in poor local optima. The reason why Unsup-SL gives strong results on all language pairs is that it uses a robust self-learning framework, which contains several techniques to avoid poor local optima.', 'Unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction (UBLI) has been shown to benefit NLP tasks for low resource languages, including unsupervised NMT BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, information retrieval BIBREF5, BIBREF6, dependency parsing BIBREF7, and named entity recognition BIBREF8, BIBREF9.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1,0.4306318333712789,100.00000000000004,0.0,0.0,1.0,"

The data was converted to a unified data format and uniformly annotated at different linguistic levels as described in Section ""Preprocessing and annotation of texts"" . To the best of our knowledge, NLI-PT is the only Portuguese dataset developed specifically for NLI, this will open avenues for research in this area.', 'As discussed in Section ""Applications"" , NLI-PT opens several avenues for future research. It can be used for different research purposes beyond NLI such as grammatical error correction and CALL. An experiment with the texts written by the speakers of five L1s: Chinese, English, German, Italian, and Spanish using a bag of words model achieved 70% accuracy. We are currently experimenting with different features taking advantage of the annotation available in NLI-PT thus reducing topic bias in classification.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1162790697674418,0.190598281671826,100.00000000000004,0.0,0.0,1.0,"

It can be trained in two different modes, algorithmically similar, but different in concept: Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and Skip-Gram model. While CBOW tries to predict the target words from the context, Skip-Gram instead aims to determine the context for a given target word. The two different approaches therefore modify only the way in which the inputs and outputs are to be managed, but in any case, the network does not change, and the training always takes place between single pairs of words (placed as one-hot in input and output).', 'Regardless of whether W2V is trained to predict the context or the target word, it is used as a word embedding in a substantially different manner from the one for which it has been trained. In particular, the second matrix is totally discarded during use, since the only thing relevant to the representation is the space of the vectors generated in the intermediate level (embedding space).', 'The common words (such as “the"", “of"", etc.) carry very little information on the target word with which they are coupled, and through backpropagation they tend to have extremely small representative vectors in the embedding space. To solve both these problems the W2V algorithm implements a particular “subsampling"" BIBREF11, which acts by eliminating some words from certain sentences. Note that the elimination of a word directly from the text means that it no longer appears in the context of any of the words of the sentence and, at the same time, a number of pairs equal to (at most) twice the size of the window relating to the deleted word will also disappear from the training set.', 'In this work we have analysed the Word2Vec model for Italian Language obtaining a substantial increase in performance respect to other two models in the literature (and despite the fixed size of the embedding). These results, in addition to the number of learning epochs, are probably also due to the different phase of data pre-processing, very carefully excuted in performing a complete cleaning of the text and above all in substituting the numerical values with a single particular token. We have observed that the number of epochs is an important parameter and its increase leads to results that rank our two worst models almost equal, or even better than others.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.5275590551181102,0.6949785879113637,100.00000000000004,0.1234567901234568,0.6119278881506961,1.0,"

            Paper passages:
            In this paper we introduce a neural semantic parser for question answering. In contrast to existing methods for question answering, we do not require annotated logical forms or execution results. Instead, we introduce a novel approach where the system is trained on a corpus of natural language questions and their program execution results. These questions can be generated automatically from a domain-specific corpus of textual questions and a corpus of executable programs. We also introduce a systematic method to generate natural language questions for the task and show how a small number of questions can be used as the input to train a neural semantic parser. We evaluate our system on two challenging question answering tasks: the WikiSQL and the KBQA tasks.
            For the WikiSQL task, the system has a 64.6% coverage and achieves an F1 score of 23.2% in the test set. For the KBQA task, the system has a 16.0% coverage and achieves an accuracy of 97.3%.

Our key idea is to use these rules to collect modest question-programs pairs as the starting point, and then leverage automatically generated examples to improve the accuracy and generality of the model. This presents three challenges including how to generate examples in an efficient way, how to measure the quality of generated examples which might contain errors and noise, and how to train a semantic parser that makes robust predictions for examples covered by rules and generalizes well to uncovered examples.', ""We study the problem in a low-resource setting. In the training process, we don't have annotated logical forms INLINEFORM0 or execution results INLINEFORM1 . Instead, we have a collection of natural language questions for the task, a limited number of simple mapping rules based on our prior knowledge about the task, and may also have a small amount of domain-independent word-level matching tables if necessary. These rules are not perfect, with low coverage, and can even be incorrect for some situations. For instance, when predicting a SQL command in the first task, we have a prior knowledge that (1) WHERE values potentially have co-occurring words with table cells; (2) the words “more” and “greater” tend to be mapped to WHERE operator “ INLINEFORM2 ”; (3) within a WHERE clause, header and cell should be in the same column; and (4) the word “average” tends to be mapped to aggregator “avg”. Similarly, when predicting a INLINEFORM3 -calculus in the third task, the entity name might be present in the question, and among all the predicates connected to the entity, the predicate with maximum number of co-occurred words might be correct. We would like to study to what extent our model can achieve if we use rules as the starting point."", 'We implement a modular approach on top of a grammar of derivation rules (actions) as the base model. Similar to BIBREF9 , our grammar consists of predefined actions used for predicting SELECT column, WHERE column, WHERE operator, WHERE value, and determining whether it is required to copy the entire action sequence of the previous turn questions. After encoding a question and previous turn questions into vectors, we first use a controller module to predict an action sequence consisting of slots, and then use specific modules to predict the argument of each slot. Similar to BIBREF9 , we use a recurrent structure as the backbone of each module and use the softmax layer for making prediction.', 'Our rule for KBQA is simple without using a curated mapping dictionary.

    Question: What is the structure of the tree?

    Paper passages:
    The proposed approach in this work is based on the concept of a document model which is a formal graphical structure, called a document tree. A document tree is a graph that represents the structure of the document. It consists of nodes (also called vertices) which represent the words of the document, and edges (also called arcs) which represent the relations between the words. A document tree can be viewed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a root node representing the whole document.
To implement the graph model, the package pydotplus is used.

Our evaluation considers two kinds of tasks: reference games and navigation games. In a reference game (e.g. fig:tasksa), both players observe a pair of candidate referents. A speaker is assigned a target referent; it must communicate this target to a listener, who then performs a choice action corresponding to its belief about the true target. In this paper we consider two variants on the reference game: a simple color-naming task, and a more complex task involving natural images of birds. For examples of human communication strategies for these tasks, we obtain the XKCD color dataset BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 and the Caltech–UCSD Birds dataset BIBREF19 with accompanying natural language descriptions BIBREF20 . We use standard train / validation / test splits for both of these datasets.', 'The final task we consider is the driving task (fig:tasksc) first discussed in the introduction.

However, we suggested that BERT trained with NSP is order-sensitive, i.e., the performance of BERT depends on the order of the input sentence pair. To verify our assumption, a primary experiment was conducted. The order of the input pair of NLI samples is reversed in the fine-tuning phase, and other hyper-parameters and settings keep the same with the BERT paper. Table TABREF19 shows the accuracy on the validation set of the MNLI and QNLI datasets. For the BERTBase model, when the sentences are swapped, the accuracy decreases by 0.5% on the MNLI task and 0.4% on the QNLI task. These results confirm that BERT trained with NSP only is indeed affected by the input order. This phenomenon motivates us to make the NSP task symmetric. The results of BERT-PN verify that BERT-PN is order-invariant. When the input order is reversed, the performance of BERT-PN remains stable. These results indicate that our method is able to remedy the order-sensitivity problem.', 'Many NLU tasks seek to model the relationship between two sentences. Semantic reasoning is performed on the sentence pair for the task-specific inference. Pair-wise semantic reasoning tasks have drawn a lot of attention from the NLP community as they largely require the comprehension ability of the learning systems. Recently, the significant improvement on these benchmarks comes from the pre-training models, e.g., BERT, StructBERT BIBREF3, ERNIE BIBREF4, BIBREF5, RoBERTa BIBREF6 and XLNet BIBREF7. These models learn from unsupervised/self-supervised objectives and perform excellently in the downstream tasks. Among these models, BERT adopts NSP as one of the objectives in the pre-training and shows that the NSP task has a positive effect on the NLI and MRC tasks. Although the primary study of XLNet and RoBERTa suggests that NSP is ineffective when the model is trained with a large sequence length of 512, the effect of NSP on the NLI problems should still be emphasized. The inefficiency of NSP is likely because the expected context length will be halved for Masked LM when taking a sentence pair as the input. The models derived from BERT, e.g., StructBERT and ERNIE 1.0/2.0, aim to incorporating more knowledge by elaborating pre-training objectives. This work aims to enhance the NSP task and verifies whether document-level information is helpful for the pre-training. To probe whether our method achieves a better regularization ability, our approach is also evaluated on the HANS BIBREF0 dataset, which contains hard data samples constructed by three heuristics. Previous advanced models such as BERT fail on the HANS dataset, and the test accuracy can barely exceed 0% in the subset of test examples.', 'Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) BIBREF1 has shown strong ability in semantic reasoning. It was recently proposed and obtained impressive results on many tasks, ranging from text classification, natural language inference, and machine reading comprehension. BERT achieves this by employing two objectives in the pre-training, i.e., the masked language modeling (Masked LM) and the next sentence prediction (NSP). Intuitively, the Masked LM task concerns word-level knowledge, and the NSP task captures the global document-level information. The goal of NSP is to identify whether an input sentence is next to another input sentence. From the ablation study BIBREF1, the NSP task is quite useful for the downstream NLI and MRC tasks (e.g., +3.5% absolute gain on the Question NLI (QNLI) BIBREF2 task).', 'Fig. FIGREF23 illustrates the accuracy of BERTBase and BERTBase-PNsmth on the HANS dataset. The evaluation is made upon the model trained on the MNLI dataset and the predicted neutral and contradiction labels are mapped into non-entailment. The BERTBase-PNsmth evidently outperforms the BERTBase with the non-entailment examples. For the non-entailment samples constructed using the lexical overlap heuristic, our model achieves 160% relative improvement over the BERTBase model. Some samples are constructed by swapping the entities in the sentence (e.g., The doctor saw the lawyer $\\nrightarrow $ The lawyer saw the doctor) and our method outperforms BERTBase by 20% in accuracy. We suggest that the Masked LM task can hardly model the relationship between two entities and NSP only is too semantically shallow to capture the precise meaning. However, the discrimination between NSP and PSP enhances the model to realize the role of entities in a given sentence. For example, to determine that A (X is beautiful) rather than $\\bar{\\texttt {A}}$ (Y is beautiful) is the previous sentence of B (Y loves X), the model have to recognize the relationship between X and Y. In contrast, when PSP is absent, NSP can be probably inferred by learning the occurrence between beautiful and loves, regardless of the sentence structure. The detailed performance of the proposed method on the HANS dataset is illustrated in Fig. FIGREF24.

    Question: How many documents in the dataset have negative sentiment?

    Paper passages:
    Finally, we transform the sentiment annotations into polarity annotations. We use the same procedure as in [4] in order to detect the polarity for each sentence. We find that 26% of the sentences are positive, 62% are negative, and the remaining 12% are neutral.

    Answer: 62%

    Question: How many documents in the dataset have positive sentiment?

    Paper passages:
    In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach to sentiment classification, which combines a novel combination of features and a rule-based classification. We have applied this method to two corpora related to the hotel industry.

    Answer: 26%

            - What results did their system obtain?

            - The results show that our approach outperforms the current state of the art, and to the best of our knowledge, no other model has achieved better performance in classifying short messages. The approach does not rely on pre-trained vectors, which provides a serious advantage when dealing with short messages of this kind. More specifically, users will often prefer to obfuscate their offensive terms using shorter slang words or create new words by `inventive' spelling and word concatenation. For instance, the word `Islamolunatic' is not available in the popular pre-trained word embeddings (Word2Vec or GloVe), even though it appears with a rather high frequency in racist postings. Hence, word frequency vectorization is preferable to the pre-trained word embeddings used in prior works if one aims to build a language-agnostic solution.

To benchmark the performance of our deep learning models, we compare them against a logistic regression (LR) baseline that learns on one-hot representations of the Java tokens extracted from the commit diffs.

The attention mechanism helps the decoder to generate meaningful and grammatical sentences without needing any sequence alignment. This idea is also in line with code-mixing by borrowing words from the embedded language BIBREF8 and intuitively, the copying mechanism can be seen as an end-to-end approach to translate, align, and reorder the given words into a grammatical code-switching sentence. This approach is the unification of all components in the work of BIBREF5 into a single computational model.

On the other hand, training using 3-best data obtains better performance compared to 1-best data. We found a positive correlation from Table TABREF6 , where 3-best data is more similar to the test set in terms of segment length and number of switches compared to 1-best data.

The Model 1 results show that a moderately augmented (35%) data set helps the training since both unaugmented and highly augmented (50%) models did not perform as well. It seems that adding too much augmented data reduces the F1 because the augmented data is noisy relative to the original data. The performance difference between Model 1 and 2 support the use of the LSTM in creating the End logit predictions. The LSTM is successfully combining the information from the Start logit and the End embeddings to provide a good input to the End logit linear layer.

The C2Q/Q2C network attends the context relative to the query and vice versa instead of as a concatenated whole. This method of attention provides more information regarding whether there is an answer to the question in the context than the original BERT attention. The skip connections improved the scores further by adding the BERT embeddings back in to the coattention vectors and providing information that may have been lost by the C2Q/Q2C network in addition to providing a convenient path for backpropagation to the BERT embedding layers.

The latter corresponds to the tendency of annotators to go beyond what the physical data can tell us, and expand their descriptions based on their past experiences and knowledge of the world.

            Highlights of the paper:
            The paper draws a distinction between the `grounded' and `ungrounded' sets of stereotype-driven descriptions. In the grounded set, the annotation is tied to the image itself, such that the description is grounded in the data. This might be an annotation that describes a visible property of an image (e.g., the color of the eyes), or an annotation that describes a property of a person in the image (e.g., whether the person is male or female). In the ungrounded set, the annotation is not grounded in the image, and may be subjective or speculative. The authors argue that the ungrounded set is a better source of information about stereotypes, and that it is easier to detect bias in the ungrounded set.
            The paper presents a number of examples of linguistic bias from the ungrounded set. For example, the authors show that the descriptions for `male' and `female' subjects tend to be more gendered than the descriptions for `neutral' subjects. They also show that the descriptions for `male' subjects tend to be more positive than the","['1605.06083-Conclusion-0', '1605.06083-Ethnicity/race-2', '1605.06083-Introduction-4', '1605.06083-Introduction-5', '1605.06083-Detecting stereotype-driven descriptions-0']","[""This paper provided a taxonomy of stereotype-driven descriptions in the Flickr30K dataset. I have divided these descriptions into two classes: linguistic bias and unwarranted inferences. The former corresponds to the annotators' choice of words when confronted with an image that may or may not match their stereotypical expectancies. The latter corresponds to the tendency of annotators to go beyond what the physical data can tell us, and expand their descriptions based on their past experiences and knowledge of the world. Acknowledging these phenomena is important, because on the one hand it helps us think about what is learnable from the data, and on the other hand it serves as a warning: if we train and evaluate language models on this data, we are effectively teaching them to be biased."", ""The numbers in Table TABREF22 are striking: there seems to be a real, systematic difference in ethnicity marking between the groups. We can take one step further and look at all the 697 pictures with the word `baby' in it.

This can be a good thing: the descriptions tell us what are the salient parts of each image to the average human annotator. So the two humans in Figure FIGREF1 are relevant, but the two soap dispensers are not. But subjectivity can also result in stereotypical descriptions, in this case suggesting that the male is more likely to be the manager, and the female is more likely to be the subordinate. rashtchian2010collecting do note that some descriptions are speculative in nature, which they say hurts the accuracy and the consistency of the descriptions. But the problem is not with the lack of consistency here. Quite the contrary: the problem is that stereotypes may be pervasive enough for the data to be consistently biased. And so language models trained on this data may propagate harmful stereotypes, such as the idea that women are less suited for leadership positions.', 'This paper aims to give an overview of linguistic bias and unwarranted inferences resulting from stereotypes and prejudices. I will build on earlier work on linguistic bias in general BIBREF3 , providing examples from the Flickr30K data, and present a taxonomy of unwarranted inferences. Finally, I will discuss several methods to analyze the data in order to detect biases.', ""In order to get an idea of the kinds of stereotype-driven descriptions that are in the Flickr30K dataset, I made a browser-based annotation tool that shows both the images and their associated descriptions.

    The dataset is biased. The dataset is biased, as it has large discrepancies in the description of the babies based on their race. For example, the white babies have 259 pictures with the word 'baby', whereas the black babies only have 63 pictures with that word. The asian babies have 165 pictures with the word 'baby'.

The fusion of visual features learned from images by deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and textual features lead to outstanding results in food recognition applications. An early approach for recipe retrieval was based on jointly learning to predict food category and its ingredients using deep CNN BIBREF16. In a following step, the predicted ingredients are matched against a large corpus of recipes. More recent approach is proposed by BIBREF15 and is based on jointly learning recipe-text and image representations in a shared latent space. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and CNN are mainly used to map text and image into the shared space. To align the text and image embedding vectors between matching recipe-image pairs, cosine similarity loss with margin was applied. Carvalho et al. BIBREF17 proposed a similar multi-modal embedding method for aligning text and image representations in a shared latent space. In contrast to Salvador et al. BIBREF15, they formulated a joint objective function which incorporates the loss for the cross-modal retrieval task and a classification loss, instead of using the latent space for a multitask learning setup. To address the challenge of encoding long sequences (like recipe instructions), BIBREF15 chose to represent single instructions as sentence embedding using the skip-thought technique BIBREF18. These encoded instruction sentences are referred to as skip-instructions and their embedding is not fine tuned when learning the image-text joint embedding.', 'The proposed model architecture is based on a multi-path approach for each of the involved input data types namely, instructions, ingredients and images, similarly to BIBREF19. In Figure FIGREF4, the overall structure is presented. For the instruction encoder, we utilized a self-attention mechanism BIBREF20, which learns which words of the instructions are relevant with a certain ingredient. In order to encode the ingredients, a bidirectional RNN is used, since ingredients are an unordered list of words. All RNNs in the ingredients path were implemented with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells BIBREF21. We fixed the ingredient representation to have a length of 600, independent of the amount of ingredients. Lastly, the outputs of the self-attention-instruction encoder with ingredient attention and the output of the bidirectional LSTM ingredient-encoder are concatenated and mapped to the joint embedding space. The image analysis path is composed of a ResNet-50 model BIBREF22, pretrained on the ImageNet Dataset BIBREF23, with a custom top layer for mapping the image features to the joint embedding space. All word embeddings are pretrained with the word2vec algorithm BIBREF24 and fine tuned during the joint embedding learning phase. We chose 512-dimensional word embedding for our model with self-attention, whereas BIBREF19 and BIBREF17 chose a vector length of 300. In the following sections, more details about the aforementioned paths are presented.', ""Similarly to BIBREF19 and BIBREF17, we evaluated our model on 10 subsets of 1000 samples each. One sample of these subsets is composed of text embedding and image embedding in the shared latent space. Since our interest lies in the recipe retrieval task, we optimized and evaluated our model by using each image embedding in the subsets as query against all text embeddings. By ranking the query and the candidate embeddings according to their cosine distance, we estimate the median rank. The model's performance is best, if the matching text embedding is found at the first rank. Further, we estimate the recall percentage at the top K percent over all queries. The recall percentage describes the quantity of queries ranked amid the top K closest results. In Table TABREF11 the results are presented, in comparison to baseline methods."", 'Figure 3: (a) Visualization of the joint embedding space under the cosine distance with semantic regularization objective.

Our model takes an advantage of feature extraction capability of CNN, LSTM as well as the deep learning benefit of deep autoencoders.

The dataset consists of 14 participants, with each prompt presented 11 times to each individual. Since our intention is to classify the phonological categories from human thoughts, we discard the facial and audio information and only consider the EEG data corresponding to imagined speech.

For these reasons, it is not particularly obvious how to decode the desired information from raw EEG signals.

    Paper passages:
    In this work we build on the observation that both neural and language models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks and can be manipulated to produce gibberish without changing the label. The main idea is to build a simple language model that predicts the probability of an input sequence not being gibberish. To this end, we define gibberish as a sequence that is not consistent or grammatical and we define consistency as the prediction of a high probability that a sequence is not gibberish. We thus build a language model that predicts the probability that a sequence is not gibberish.

It is a major hurdle to optimally encode information from these EEG data into lower dimensional space. In fact, our investigation based on a development set (as we explain later) showed that well-known deep neural networks (e.g., fully connected networks such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and autoencoders) fail to individually learn such complex feature representations from single-trial EEG data. Besides, we found that instead of using the raw multi-channel high-dimensional EEG requiring large training times and resource requirements, it is advantageous to first reduce its dimensionality by capturing the information transfer among the electrodes. Instead of the conventional approach of selecting a handful of channels as BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , we address this by computing the channel cross-covariance, resulting in positive, semi-definite matrices encoding the connectivity of the electrodes. We define channel cross-covariance (CCV) between any two electrodes INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 as: INLINEFORM2 . Next, we reject the channels which have significantly lower cross-covariance than auto-covariance values (where auto-covariance implies CCV on same electrode). We found this measure to be essential as the higher cognitive processes underlying speech planning and synthesis involve frequent information exchange between different parts of the brain. Hence, such matrices often contain more discriminative features and hidden information than mere raw signals. This is essentially different than our previous work BIBREF16 where we extract per-channel 1-D covariance information and feed it to the networks.

            They combine the socioeconomic maps with Twitter data by using a combination of some of the following techniques:

            - Geolocation: They use Twitter's geolocation feature to identify the approximate location of each user. This information is then used to assign each user to a specific socioeconomic class based on the socioeconomic map of their region.

            - Socioeconomic indicators: they use socioeconomic indicators such as income, employment status, and education level to assign users to specific socioeconomic classes.

            - Social network analysis: They use social network analysis to identify connections between users and their socioeconomic status. By looking at who users connect with, they can get a better understanding of how socioeconomic status may influence social interactions on Twitter.

             For example, they could look at the number of times a user with a high socioeconomic status mentions another user with a high socioeconomic status, as opposed to a user with a low socioeconomic status.

To do so we constructed a combined dataset from a large Twitter data corpus, including geotagged posts and proxy social interactions of millions of users, as well as a detailed socioeconomic map describing average socioeconomic indicators with a high spatial resolution in France. The combination of these datasets provided us with a large set of Twitter users all assigned to their Twitter timeline over three years, their location, three individual socioeconomic indicators, and a set of meaningful social ties. Three linguistic variables extracted from individual Twitter timelines were then studied as a function of the former, namely, the rate of standard negation, the rate of plural agreement and the size of vocabulary set.', 'To do so, first we took the geolocated Twitter users in France and partitioned them into nine socioeconomic classes using their inferred income $S_\\mathrm {inc}^u$ . Partitioning was done first by sorting users by their $S^u_\\mathrm {inc}$ income to calculate their $C(S^u_\\mathrm {inc})$ cumulative income distribution function. We defined socioeconomic classes by segmenting $C(S^u_\\mathrm {inc})$ such that the sum of income is the same for each classes (for an illustration of our method see Fig. 6 a in the Appendix). We constructed a social network by considering mutual mention links between these users (as introduced in Section ""Data Description"" ). Taking the assigned socioeconomic classes of connected individuals, we confirmed the effects of status homophily in the Twitter mention network by computing the connection matrix of socioeconomic groups normalized by the equivalent matrix of corresponding configuration model networks, which conserved all network properties except structural correlations (as explained in the Appendix). The diagonal component in Fig. 6 matrix indicated that users of similar socioeconomic classes were better connected, while people from classes far apart were less connected than one would expect by chance from the reference model with users connected randomly.', 'Many studies have overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the geolocation feature allowing Twitter users to include in their posts the location from which they were tweeted. Based on this metadata, studies have been able to assign home location to geolocated users with varying degrees of accuracy BIBREF15 . Subsequent work has also been devoted to assigning to each user some indicator that might characterize their socioeconomic status based on their estimated home location. These indicators are generally extracted from other datasets used to complete the Twitter one, namely census data BIBREF16 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF17 or real estate online services as Zillow.com BIBREF18 . Other approaches have also relied on sources of socioeconomic information such as the UK Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) hierarchy, to assign socioeconomic status to users with occupation mentions BIBREF19 . Despite the relative success of these methods, their common limitation is to provide observations and predictions based on a carefully hand-picked small set of users, letting alone the problem of socioeconomic status inference on larger and more heterogeneous populations. Our work stands out from this well-established line of research by expanding the definition of socioeconomic status to include several demographic features as well as by pinpointing potential home location to individual users with an unprecedented accuracy. Identifying socioeconomic status and the network effects of homophily BIBREF20 is an open question BIBREF21 . However, recent results already showed that status homophily, i.e. the tendency of people of similar socioeconomic status are better connected among themselves, induce structural correlations which are pivotal to understand the stratified structure of society BIBREF22 . While we verify the presence of status homophily in the Twitter social network, we detect further sociolinguistic correlations between language, location, socioeconomic status, and time, which may inform novel methods to infer socioeconomic status for a broader set of people using common information available on Twitter.', 'Despite these findings, one has to acknowledge the multiple limitations affecting this work: First of all, although Twitter is a broadly adopted service in most technologically enabled societies, it commonly provides a biased sample in terms of age and socioeconomic status as older or poorer people may not have access to this technology. In addition, home locations inferred for lower activity users may induced some noise in our inference method. Nevertheless, we demonstrated that our selected Twitter users are quite representative in terms of spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic distributions once compared to census data. Other sources of bias include the ""homogenization"" performed by INSEE to ensure privacy rights are upheld as well as the proxies we devised to approximate users\' home location and social network. Currently, a sample survey of our set of geolocated users is being conducted so as to bootstrap socioeconomic data to users and definitely validate our inference results. Nonetheless, this INSEE dataset provides still the most comprehensive available information on socioeconomic status over the whole country. For limiting such risk of bias, we analyzed the potential effect of the confounding variables on distribution and cross-correlations of SES indicators. Acknowledging possible limitations of this study, we consider it as a necessary first step in analyzing income through social media using datasets orders of magnitude larger than in previous research efforts.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.2610619469026548,0.7095202322281253,100.00000000000004,0.08099688473520249,0.35505835977686845,1.0,"

It constructs the largest dataset of French tweets enriched with census sociodemographic information existent to date to the best of our knowledge. From this dataset, we observed variation of two grammatical cues and an index of vocabulary size in users located in France. We study how the linguistic cues correlated with three features reflective of the socioeconomic status of the users, their most representative location and their daily periods of activity on Twitter. We also observed whether connected people are more linguistically alike than disconnected ones. Multivariate analysis shows strong correlations between linguistic cues and socioeconomic status as well as a broad spatial pattern never observed before, with more standard language variants and lexical diversity in the southern part of the country. Moreover, we found an unexpected daily cyclic evolution of the frequency of standard variants. Further analysis revealed that the observed cycle arose from the ever changing average economic status of the population of users present in Twitter through the day. Finally, we were able to establish that linguistic similarity between connected people does arises partially but not uniquely due to status homophily (users with similar socioeconomic status are linguistically similar and tend to connect).

Although officially a standard language is used over the whole country, geographic variations of the former may exist due to several reasons BIBREF37 , BIBREF38 . For instance, regional variability resulting from remnants of local languages that have disappeared, uneven spatial distribution of socioeconomic potentials, or influence spreading from neighboring countries might play a part in this process. For the observation of such variability, by using their representative locations, we assigned each user to a department of France. We then computed the $\\overline{L}^{i}_{\\mathrm {cn}}$ (resp. $\\overline{L}^{i}_{\\mathrm {cp}}$ ) average rates of standard negation (resp. plural agreement) and the $\\overline{L}^{i}_\\mathrm {vs}$ average vocabulary set size for each ""département"" $i$ in the country (administrative division of France – There are 97 départements).', 'Results shown in Fig. 3 a-c revealed some surprising patterns, which appeared to be consistent for each linguistic variable. By considering latitudinal variability it appeared that, overall, people living in the northern part of the country used a less standard language, i.e., negated and pluralized less standardly, and used a smaller number of words. On the other hand, people from the South used a language which is somewhat closer to the standard (in terms of the aforementioned linguistic markers) and a more diverse vocabulary. The most notable exception is Paris, where in the city center people used more standard language, while the contrary is true for the suburbs. This observation, better shown in Fig. 3 a inset, can be explained by the large differences in average socioeconomic status between districts. Such segregation is known to divide the Eastern and Western sides of suburban Paris, and in turn to induce apparent geographic patterns of standard language usage. We found less evident longitudinal dependencies of the observed variables. Although each variable shows a somewhat diagonal trend, the most evident longitudinal dependency appeared for the average rate of standard pluralization (see Fig. 3 b), where users from the Eastern side of the country used the language in less standard ways. Note that we also performed a multivariate regression analysis (not shown here), using the linguistic markers as target and considering as factors both location (in terms of latitude and longitude) as and income as proxy of socioeconomic status. It showed that while location is a strong global determinant of language variability, socioeconomic variability may still be significant locally to determine standard language usage (just as we demonstrated in the case of Paris).', 'Sociolinguistics has traditionally carried out research on the quantitative analysis of the so-called linguistic variables, i.e. points of the linguistic system which enable speakers to say the same thing in different ways, with these variants being ""identical in reference or truth value, but opposed in their social [...] significance"" BIBREF4 . Such variables have been described in many languages: variable pronunciation of -ing as [in] instead of [iŋ] in English (playing pronounced playin\'); optional realization of the first part of the French negation (je (ne) fume pas, ""I do not smoke""); optional realization of the plural ending of verb in Brazilian Portuguese (eles disse(ram), ""they said""). For decades, sociolinguistic studies have showed that hearing certain variants triggers social stereotypes BIBREF5 . The so-called standard variants (e.g. [iŋ], realization of negative ne and plural -ram) are associated with social prestige, high education, professional ambition and effectiveness. They are more often produced in more formal situation. Non-standard variants are linked to social skills, solidarity and loyalty towards the local group, and they are produced more frequently in less formal situation.', 'In Fig. 4 a and b we show the temporal variability of $\\overline{L}^{\\Lambda }_{\\mathrm {cn}}(t)$ and $\\overline{L}^{\\Lambda }_{\\mathrm {cp}}(t)$ (respectively) computed for the whole Twitter user set ( $\\Gamma =all$ , solid line) and for geolocated users ( $\\Gamma =geo$ , dashed lines).

    Standard language is defined as the average or normal language. It is usually used to say what is common or normal.

    The use of standard language is important for a number of reasons.
    For one, it helps to clarify meaning.
    It also helps to create a sense of community.
    And it can help to build trust.
    Standard language can be used in both formal and informal settings.

    Answer:

    Standard language is a term that describes the way that a language is used in a particular context.

    It is important to understand the context in which a language is used in order to understand how it has been standardized.

    There are many different ways that a language can be standardized.

    For example, the language used in a business setting may be more formal than the language used in a casual setting.

    The language used in a professional setting may be more technical than the language used in a personal setting.

    The answer to the question ""How did they define standard language?"" is that it depends on the context in which the language is being used.

The fourth block reports results with fine-tuned Bert models: BertSumExt and its two variants (one without interval embeddings, and one with the large version of Bert), BertSumAbs, and BertSumExtAbs. Bert-based models outperform the Lead-3 baseline which is not a strawman; on the CNN/DailyMail corpus it is indeed superior to several extractive BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF19 and abstractive models BIBREF6. Bert models collectively outperform all previously proposed extractive and abstractive systems, only falling behind the Oracle upper bound. Among Bert variants, BertSumExt performs best which is not entirely surprising; CNN/DailyMail summaries are somewhat extractive and even abstractive models are prone to copying sentences from the source document when trained on this dataset BIBREF6. Perhaps unsurprisingly we observe that larger versions of Bert lead to performance improvements and that interval embeddings bring only slight gains. Table TABREF24 presents results on the NYT dataset.

            Our experiments on the CoNLL-YAGO dataset showed that the model can be trained to perform well not only on entity mentions, but also on entities themselves. We achieve this by using the same representation of entities as we use for word mentions, and by using the same set of entity features. We found that entity features for the CoNLL-YAGO dataset can be selected from the features learned from the training data. For this, we used the same set of features that worked well for the WikiLinksNED dataset.

We conduct our annotation study on Amazon Mechanical Turk, presenting Turkers with Human Intelligence Tasks (henceforth, HITs) consisting of a single conversation between a customer and an agent. In each HIT, we present Turkers with a definition of each dialogue act, as well as a sample annotated dialogue for reference. For each turn in the conversation, we allow Turkers to select as many labels from our taxonomy as required to fully characterize the intent of the turn. Additionally, annotators are asked three questions at the end of each conversation HIT, to which they could respond that they agreed, disagreed, or could not tell:']","
            First, we develop a fine-grained dialogue act taxonomy for customer service and conduct a systematic user study to identify these acts in a dataset of 800 conversations (i.e. four different companies in the telecommunication, electronics, and insurance industries). Next, we predict our fine-grained dialogue acts while a conversation is in progress, using a novel multi-label scheme to classify each turn. Then, using our dialogue act predictions, we classify conversations based on the outcomes of customer satisfaction, frustration, and problem resolution, then provide actionable guidelines for the development of automated customer service systems and intelligent agents aimed at desired customer outcomes BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 .

Each classification experiments centers around one of three problem outcomes: customer satisfaction, problem resolution, and customer frustration. For each outcome, we remove any conversation that did not receive majority consensus for a label, or received majority vote of ""can\'t tell"". Our final conversation sets consist of 216 satisfied and 500 unsatisfied customer conversations, 271 resolved and 425 unresolved problem conversations, and 534 frustrated and 229 not frustrated customer conversations. We retain the inherent imbalance in the data to match the natural distribution observed. The clear excess of consensus of responses that indicate negative outcomes further motivates us to understand what sorts of dialogic patterns results in such outcomes.', 'We first expand upon previous work and generic dialogue act taxonomies, developing a fine-grained set of dialogue acts for customer service, and conducting a systematic user study to identify these acts in a dataset of 800 conversations from four Twitter customer service accounts (i.e. four different companies in the telecommunication, electronics, and insurance industries). We then aim to understand the conversation flow between customers and agents using our taxonomy, so we develop a real-time sequential SVM-HMM model to predict our fine-grained dialogue acts while a conversation is in progress, using a novel multi-label scheme to classify each turn. Finally, using our dialogue act predictions, we classify conversations based on the outcomes of customer satisfaction, frustration, and overall problem resolution, then provide actionable guidelines for the development of automated customer service systems and intelligent agents aimed at desired customer outcomes BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 .', 'In this work, we are motivated to predict the dialogue acts in conversations with the intent of identifying problem spots that can be addressed in real-time, and to allow for post-conversation analysis to derive rules about conversation outcomes indicating successful/unsuccessful interactions, namely, customer satisfaction, customer frustration, and problem resolution. We focus on analysis of the dialogue acts used in customer service conversations as a first step to fully automating the interaction. We address various different challenges: dialogue act annotated data is not available for customer service on Twitter, the task of dialogue act annotation is subjective, existing taxonomies do not capture the fine-grained information we believe is valuable to our task, and tweets, although concise in nature, often consist of overlapping dialogue acts to characterize their full intent. The novelty of our work comes from the development of our fine-grained dialogue act taxonomy and multi-label approach for act prediction, as well as our analysis of the customer service domain on Twitter. Our goal is to offer useful analytics to improve outcome-oriented conversational systems.', 'We establish that agents are more predictable than customers in terms of the dialogue acts they utilize, and set out to understand whether the conversation strategies agents employ are well-correlated with desirable conversation outcomes. We conduct binary classification experiments to analyze how our predicted dialogue acts can be used to classify conversations as ending in customer satisfaction, customer frustration, and problem resolution. We observe interesting correlations between the dialogue acts agents use and the outcomes, offering insights into good/bad practices that are more useful for creating context-aware automated customer service systems than generating canned response templates.', 'We also calculate the Fleiss- INLINEFORM0 values for each label, and use the categories defined by Landis and Koch to bin our speech acts based on agreement BIBREF27 . As shown in Table TABREF18 , we find that the per-label agreement varies from ""almost perfect"" agreement of INLINEFORM1 for lexically defined categories such as Apology and Thanks, with only slight agreement of INLINEFORM2 for less clearly-defined categories, such as Statement (Other), Answer Response Acknowledgement and Request (Other). For the conversation-level questions, we calculate the agreement across the ""Agree"" label for all annotators, finding an average Fleiss- INLINEFORM3 , with question-level results of INLINEFORM4 for customer satisfaction, INLINEFORM5 for problem resolution, and INLINEFORM6 for customer frustration. These results suggest room for improvement for further development of the taxonomy, to address problem areas for annotators and remedy areas of lower agreement.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.2692307692307692,0.224243030691222,100.00000000000004,0.08547008547008547,1.781505980639769,1.0," - Question: What is the name of the company?

Our approach is motivated by the fact that these alignment methods do not change the structure of the individual monolingual spaces.

Why does the model improve in monolingual spaces as well? ,['1808.08780-Experiments-9'],['because word pair similarity increases if the two words translate to similar parts of the cross-lingual embedding space'],"['As a complement of this analysis we show some qualitative results which give us further insights on the transformations of the vector space after our average approximation. In particular, we analyze the reasons behind the higher quality displayed by our bilingual embeddings in monolingual settings. While VecMap and MUSE do not transform the initial monolingual spaces, our model transforms both spaces simultaneously. In this analysis we focus on the source language of our experiments (i.e., English). We found interesting patterns which are learned by our model and help understand these monolingual gains. For example, a recurring pattern is that words in English which are translated to the same word, or to semantically close words, in the target language end up closer together after our transformation. For example, in the case of English-Spanish the following pairs were among the pairs whose similarity increased the most by applying our transformation: cellphone-telephone, movie-film, book-manuscript or rhythm-cadence, which are either translated to the same word in Spanish (i.e., teléfono and película in the first two cases) or are already very close in the Spanish space. More generally, we found that word pairs which move together the most tend to be semantically very similar and belong to the same domain, e.g., car-bicycle, opera-cinema, or snow-ice.']","
            We believe that the most insightful explanation of the results above is that the linear transformations that we apply to move the monolingual spaces closer together are a crucial part in the process of learning a unified bilingual space. This is further supported by the fact that our model clearly outperforms all the baselines on the cross-lingual evaluation tasks, where no monolingual data was leveraged for training. The results show that our model is able to learn a better-aligned monolingual space for both training languages, and that this improvement translates to higher cross-lingual performance.

            Even in the case where no training data was given in the target language, our model still outperforms the unsupervised baseline. This indicates that our model is able to learn a more aligned monolingual space for both languages, which leads to an improved performance on cross-lingual tasks.

            Our hypothesis is that, by averaging across the vectors of the two monolingual spaces, we are able to reduce the impact of language-specific phenomena and corpus-specific biases, which ultimately leads to more accurate and more stable predictions across the entire bilingual space.

This can be achieved by imposing an orthogonality constraint on the linear transformation BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 . Our hypothesis in this paper is that such approaches can be further improved, as they rely on the assumption that the internal structure of the two monolingual spaces is identical. In reality, however, this structure is influenced by language-specific phenomena, e.g., the fact that Spanish distinguishes between masculine and feminine nouns BIBREF8 as well as the specific biases of the different corpora from which the monolingual spaces were learned. Because of this, monolingual embedding spaces are not isomorphic BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 .

    Causal attribution networks are networks that reflect the cause-effect relationships proposed by humans. They are constructed by collecting text pairs that reflect these relationships, in which each pair identifies the nodes of the network (e.g. “virus” and “sickness”) and the directed edges (e.g. “virus” $\to$ “sickness”). These edges represent the causal attributions between the nodes.
    In this work, we use causal attribution networks to represent the causal relationships between events and entities.

The analysis for each label shows that the accuracy of contradiction and neutral labels is quite stable, while the accuracy of the entailment examples drops significantly with latent dimensionality. One reason for this is that the hypothesis space of the entailment label is smaller than the spaces of other two labels. Thus, when the dimensionality is higher, more creative examples are generated, and these examples less often comply with the entailment label.', 'In this paper, we have proposed several generative neural networks for generating hypothesis using NLI dataset. To evaluate these models we propose the accuracy of classifier trained on the generated dataset as the main metric. The best model achieved INLINEFORM0 accuracy, which is only INLINEFORM1 less than the accuracy of the classifier trained on the original human written dataset, while the best dataset combined with the original dataset has achieved the highest accuracy. This model learns a decoder and a mapping embedding for each training example. It outperforms the more standard encoder-decoder networks. Although more parameters are needed to be trained, less are updated on each batch. We have also shown that the attention mechanism improves the model. The analysis has confirmed our hypothesis that a good dataset contains accurate, non-trivial and comprehensible examples. To further examine the quality of generated hypothesis, they were compared against the original human written hypotheses. The discriminative evaluation shows that in INLINEFORM2 of cases the human evaluator incorrectly distinguished between the original and the generated hypothesis. The discriminative model was actually better in distinguishing. We have also compared the accuracy of classifier to other metrics.

The best generated dataset was generated by AttEmbedDecoder. The accuracy of its classifier is only 2.7 % lower than the accuracy of classifier generated on the original human crafted dataset. The comparison of the best generated dataset to the original dataset shows that the datasets had only INLINEFORM0 of identical examples. The average length of the hypothesis was INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 in the original dataset and in the generated dataset, respectively. In another experiment the generated dataset and the original dataset were merged to train a new classifier. Thus, the merged dataset contained twice as many examples as other datasets. The accuracy of this classifier was 82.0%, which is 0.8 % better than the classifier trained solely on the original training set.

It is becoming more challenging since recent conversational interaction systems such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana support more than thousands of domains developed by external developers BIBREF3, BIBREF2, BIBREF4. As they are independently and rapidly developed without a centralized ontology, multiple domains have overlapped capabilities that can process the same utterances. For example, “make an elephant sound” can be processed by AnimalSounds, AnimalNoises, and ZooKeeper domains.', 'In this paper, we utilize user log data, which contain triples of an utterance, the predicted domain, and the response, for the model training. Therefore, we are given only one ground-truth for each training utterance. In order to improve the classification performance in this setting, if certain domains are repeatedly predicted with the highest confidences even though they are not the ground-truths of an utterance, we regard the domains as additional pseudo labels. This is closely related to pseudo labeling BIBREF7 or self-training BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10. While the conventional pseudo labeling is used to derive target labels for unlabeled data, our approach adds pseudo labels to singly labeled data so that the data can have multiple target labels. Also, the approach is related to self-distillation, which leverages the confidence scores of the non-target outputs to improve the model performance BIBREF11, BIBREF12.

The accuracy of the goal position can be seen in Figure FIGREF4(left) which shows another aspect of our approach: By using stochastic forward passes BIBREF26 the model can return an estimate for the validity of a requested task in addition to the predicted goal configuration. The figure shows that the goal position of a red bowl has a relatively small distribution independently of the used sentence or location on the table, where as an invalid target (green) produces a significantly larger distribution, indicating that the requested task may be invalid.', 'A fundamental challenge in imitation learning is the extraction of policies that do not only cover the trained scenarios, but also generalize to a wide range of other situations. A large body of literature has addressed the problem of learning robot motor skills by imitation BIBREF6, learning functional BIBREF1 or probabilistic BIBREF7 representations. However, in most of these approaches, the state vector has to be carefully designed in order to ensure that all necessary information for adaptation is available. Neural approaches to imitation learning BIBREF8 circumvent this problem by learning suitable feature representations from rich data sources for each task or for a sequence of tasks BIBREF9, BIBREF10, BIBREF11. Many of these approaches assume that either a sufficiently large set of motion primitives is already available or that a taxonomy of the task is available, i.e., semantics and motions are not trained in conjunction. The importance of maintaining this connection has been shown in BIBREF12, allowing the robot to adapt to untrained variations of the same task. To learn entirely new tasks, meta-learning aims at learning policy parameters that can quickly be fine-tuned to new tasks BIBREF13. While very successful in dealing with visual and spatial information, these approaches do not incorporate any semantic or linguistic component into the learning process. Language has shown to successfully generate task descriptions in BIBREF14 and several works have investigated the idea of combining natural language and imitation learning: BIBREF15, BIBREF16, BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF19. However, most approaches do not utilize the inherent connection between semantic task descriptions and low-level motions to train a model.', 'We evaluate our model in a simulated binning task in which the robot is tasked to place a cube into a bowl as outlined by the verbal command.

            As per the paper, the system learns in supervised learning manner. Imitation learning is a supervised learning problem where the model learns to predict the next action given the current state. Here, the model is able to learn from the demonstrations of the intended behavior and distills the demonstrations into a robot control policy by learning appropriate parameter settings of the controller.

            The paper says that “Programming such policies is a labor and time-consuming process which requires substantial technical expertise.” However, the system learns the policy without any human intervention in the learning process. Thus, the system is not able to learn in reinforcement learning manner.

Imitation learning BIBREF0, is an appealing methodology that aims at overcoming this challenge – instead of complex programming, the user only provides a set of demonstrations of the intended behavior. These demonstrations are consequently distilled into a robot control policy by learning appropriate parameter settings of the controller. Popular approaches to imitation, such as Dynamic Motor Primitives (DMPs) BIBREF1 or Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) BIBREF2 largely focus on motion as the sole input and output modality, i.e., joint angles, forces or positions. Critical semantic and visual information regarding the task, such as the appearance of the target object or the type of task performed, is not taken into account during training and reproduction. The result is often a limited generalization capability which largely revolves around adaptation to changes in the object position. While imitation learning has been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks including table-tennis BIBREF3, locomotion BIBREF4, and human-robot interaction BIBREF5 an important question is how to incorporate language and vision into a differentiable end-to-end system for complex robot control.', 'Figure 1: Network architecture overview. The network consists of two parts, a high-level semantic network and a low-level control network. Both networks are working seamlessly together and are utilized in an End-to-End fashion.', 'In this paper, we present an imitation learning approach that combines language, vision, and motion in order to synthesize natural language-conditioned control policies that have strong generalization capabilities while also capturing the semantics of the task. We argue that such a multi-modal teaching approach enables robots to acquire complex policies that generalize to a wide variety of environmental conditions based on descriptions of the intended task. In turn, the network produces control parameters for a lower-level control policy that can be run on a robot to synthesize the corresponding motion. The hierarchical nature of our approach, i.e., a high-level policy generating the parameters of a lower-level policy, allows for generalization of the trained task to a variety of spatial, visual and contextual changes.', 'In this work, we presented an imitation learning approach combining language, vision, and motion.

To teach this task, the human demonstrator does not only provide a kinesthetic demonstration of the desired trajectory, but also a verbal command, e.g., “Move towards the blue bowl” to the robot. In this example, the trajectory generation would have to be conditioned on the blue bowl's position which, however, has to be extracted from visual sensing. Our approach automatically detects and extracts these relationships between vision, language, and motion modalities in order to make best usage of contextual information for better generalization and disambiguation.""]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.2099737532808399,0.3440959837320865,100.00000000000004,0.0,0.0,1.0,"1.

Further analyses exhibit that lattice input takes advantages of word and character level information, and the vocabulary based lattice constructor outperforms the strategies that combine characters and different word segmentations together.', 'As we mentioned in previous section, we can not directly apply standard CNNs to take word lattice as input, since there could be multiple feature vectors produced for a given word. Inspired by previous lattice LSTM models BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , here we propose a lattice based CNN layers to allow standard CNNs to work over word lattice input. Specifically, we utilize pooling mechanisms to merge the feature vectors produced by multiple CNN kernels over different context compositions.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1899999999999999,0.3273673690911556,100.00000000000004,0.19753086419753085,1.3438440993016116,1.0,"
    The answer is simple. It is based on the Chinese word segmentation algorithm. Firstly, it segments a sentence into words. Then, it builds a word lattice. Finally, it obtains word lattices from words.

This simulates an annotation strategy in which we route difficult instances to domain experts and easier ones to crowd annotators. We also contrast the value of difficult data to that of an i.i.d. random sample of the same size, both annotated by experts.', 'The results show adding more training data with crowd annotation still improves at least 1 point F1 score in all three extraction tasks. The improvement when the difficult subset with expert annotations is mixed with the remaining crowd annotation is 3.5 F1 score, much larger than when a random set of expert annotations are added. The model trained with re-annotating the difficult subset (D+Other) also outperforms the model with re-annotating the random subset (R+Other) by 2 points in F1. The model trained with re-annotating both of difficult and random subsets (D+R+Other), however, achieves only marginally higher F1 than the model trained with the re-annotated difficult subset (D+Other). In sum, the results clearly indicate that mixing expert and crowd annotations leads to better models than using solely crowd data, and better than using expert data alone. More importantly, there is greater gain in performance when instances are routed according to difficulty, as compared to randomly selecting the data for expert annotators. These findings align with our motivating hypothesis that annotation quality for difficult instances is important for final model performance. They also indicate that mixing annotations from expert and crowd could be an effective way to achieve acceptable model performance given a limited budget.', 'We re-annotate by experts a subset of most difficult instances and the same number of random instances. As collecting annotations from experts is slow and expensive, we only re-annotate the difficult instances for the interventions extraction task.

    With regards to the synthetic dataset, I can guess that they have generated a dataset from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The steps to create a synthetic dataset is as follow.

    1. Firstly, they generate random samples from a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
    2. Then, they perform some operations on the sample and create another sample.

    3. They repeat the above steps until they have a dataset.

    They also mentioned that they have a control over the distribution of the data. This means that they have a control over the variance of the distribution. This is because they can set the variance for each dimension of the multivariate Gaussian distribution.

    Therefore, in this paper, they have used a 2 dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution to generate the dataset.

When constructing and maintaining lexical databases, such as DIM, the Icelandic wordnet or other related resources, it is vital to be able to systematically add neologies and words that are missing from the datasets, especially those commonly used in the language. Within the LT programme a flexible lexicon acquisition tool will be developed. It will be able to identify and collect unknown words and word forms, together with statistics, through structured lexical acquisition from the Icelandic Gigaword Corpus, which is constantly being updated, and other data sources in the same format.', 'Software implementation and research. The research areas are chosen so to enhance the language resource development for Icelandic. A punctuation system for Icelandic will be analysed and implemented. Compound words are common in Icelandic and the language also has a relatively rich inflection structure so it is important to address those features for language modeling. Pronunciation analysis, speaker diarization and speech analysis will also be addressed especially for Icelandic, and acoustic modelling for children and teenagers receive attention in the project.', 'Software development. The software development tasks of the spell and grammar checking project will build a working open source correction system whose development is informed by the analysis of the data sets created within the project. The spell and grammar checker will be based on the foundation for processing Icelandic text provided by the Greynir system.', 'Baseline system. In this part, three baseline MT systems will be developed. First, a statistical phrase-based MT system based on Moses BIBREF41, second, a bidirectional LSTM model using the neural translation system OpenNMT BIBREF42, and, third, a system based on an attention-based neural network BIBREF43 using Tensor2Tensor.

An API and a web user interface for the three baseline systems, mentioned in item 3 above, will be developed to give interested parties access to the systems under development, and to establish a testing environment in which members of the public can submit their own text. Thus, results from the three systems can be compared directly, as well as to the translations produced by Google Translate.

The languages covered are typologically diverse and include also under-resourced ones, such as Welsh and Kiswahili. The resource covers an unprecedented amount of 1,888 word pairs, carefully balanced according to their similarity score, frequency, concreteness, part-of-speech class, and lexical field. In addition to Multi-Simlex, we release the detailed protocol we followed to create this resource. We hope that our consistent guidelines will encourage researchers to translate and annotate Multi-Simlex -style datasets for additional languages. This can help and create a hugely valuable, large-scale semantic resource for multilingual NLP research.', 'Most importantly, semantic similarity datasets in different languages have been created using heterogeneous construction procedures with different guidelines for translation and annotation, as well as different rating scales. For instance, some datasets were obtained by directly translating the English SimLex-999 in its entirety BIBREF25, BIBREF16 or in part BIBREF28. Other datasets were created from scratch BIBREF26 and yet others sampled English concept pairs differently from SimLex-999 and then translated and reannotated them in target languages BIBREF27. This heterogeneity makes these datasets incomparable and precludes systematic cross-linguistic analyses. In this article, consolidating the lessons learned from previous dataset construction paradigms, we propose a carefully designed translation and annotation protocol for developing monolingual Multi-SimLex datasets with aligned concept pairs for typologically diverse languages. We apply this protocol to a set of 12 languages, including a mixture of major languages (e.g., Mandarin, Russian, and French) as well as several low-resource ones (e.g., Kiswahili, Welsh, and Yue Chinese).

    Question: Why is Russian spoken by so many people?

    Paper passages:
    In the same region of the world, Russian is spoken by high numbers of speakers, due to its use as a lingua franca among ethnic minorities. According to the 2010 census, Russian is the second most widely spoken language in the world (after Mandarin Chinese) with 138 million native speakers. According to ethnologue.com, there are a total of 165 million speakers of Russian, including L1 and L2 speakers, where 108 million of them are native speakers. As of 2010, Russian is the eighth most widely spoken language by number of speakers.

In Go-Explore we also count the actions used to restore the environment to a selected cell, i.e. to bring the agent to the state represented in the selected cell. This allows a one-to-one comparison of the exploration efficiency between Go-Explore and algorithms that use a count-based reward in text-based games. Importantly, BIBREF8 showed that DQN and DRQN, without such counting rewards, could never find a successful trajectory in hard games such as the ones used in our experiments. Figure FIGREF17 shows the number of interactions with the environment (frames) versus the maximum score obtained, averaged over 10 games of the same difficulty. As shown by BIBREF8, DRQN++ finds a trajectory with the maximum score faster than to DQN++. On the other hand, phase 1 of Go-Explore finds an optimal trajectory with approximately half the interactions with the environment. Moreover, the trajectory length found by Go-Explore is always optimal (i.e. 30 steps) whereas both DQN++ and DRQN++ have an average length of 38 and 42 respectively.', 'In CookingWorld, we compared models in the three settings mentioned earlier, namely, single, joint, and zero-shot. In all experiments, we measured the sum of the final scores of all the games and their trajectory length (number of steps). Table TABREF26 summarizes the results in these three settings. Phase 1 of Go-Explore on single games achieves a total score of 19,530 (sum over all games), which is very close to the maximum possible points (i.e. 19,882), with 47,562 steps. A winning trajectory was found in 4,279 out of the total of 4,440 games. This result confirms again that the exploration strategy of Go-Explore is effective in text-based games. Next, we evaluate the effectiveness and the generalization ability of the simple imitation learning policy trained using the extracted trajectories in phase 1 of Go-Explore in the three settings mentioned above.', 'In this setting, each model is trained from scratch in each of the 4,440 games based on the trajectory found in phase 1 of Go-Explore (previous step). As shown in Table TABREF26, the LSTM-DQN BIBREF7, BIBREF8 approach without the use of admissible actions performs poorly. One explanation for this could be that it is difficult for this model to explore both language and game strategy at the same time; it is hard for the model to find a reward signal before it has learned to model language, since almost none of its actions will be admissible, and those reward signals are what is necessary in order to learn the language model. As we see in Table TABREF26, however, by using the admissible actions in the $\\epsilon $-greedy step the score achieved by the LSTM-DQN increases dramatically (+ADM row in Table TABREF26). DRRN BIBREF10 achieves a very high score, since it explicitly learns how to rank admissible actions (i.e. a much simpler task than generating text). Finally, our approach of using a Seq2Seq model trained on the single trajectory provided by phase 1 of Go-Explore achieves the highest score among all the methods, even though we do not use admissible actions in this phase. However, in this experiment the Seq2Seq model cannot perfectly replicate the provided trajectory and the total score that it achieves is in fact 9.4% lower compared to the total score achieved by phase 1 of Go-Explore. Figure FIGREF61 (in Appendix SECREF60) shows the score breakdown for each level and model, where we can see that the gap between our model and other methods increases as the games become harder in terms of skills needed.', 'In this setting the 4,440 games are split into training, validation, and test games. The split is done randomly but in a way that different difficulty levels (recipes 1, 2 and 3), are represented with equal ratios in all the 3 splits, i.e. stratified by difficulty. As shown in Table TABREF26, the zero-shot performance of the RL baselines is poor, which could be attributed to the same reasons why RL baselines under-perform in the Joint case. Especially interesting is that the performance of DRRN is substantially lower than that of the Go-Explore Seq2Seq model, even though the DRRN model has access to the admissible actions at test time, while the Seq2Seq model (as well as the LSTM-DQN model) has to construct actions token-by-token from the entire vocabulary of 20,000 tokens. On the other hand, Go-Explore Seq2Seq shows promising results by solving almost half of the unseen games. Figure FIGREF62 (in Appendix SECREF60) shows that most of the lost games are in the hardest set, where a very long sequence of actions is required for winning the game. These results demonstrate both the relative effectiveness of training a Seq2Seq model on Go-Explore trajectories, but they also indicate that additional effort needed for designing reinforcement learning algorithms that effectively generalize to unseen games.', 'Table 3: CookingWorld results on the three evaluated settings single, joint and zero-shot.']","

            Experimental results show that our proposed Go-Explore exploration strategy is a viable methodology for extracting high-performing trajectories in text-based games.

            To address this challenge, we propose to use the idea behind the recently proposed Go-Explore BIBREF0 algorithm. Specifically, we propose to first extract high reward trajectories of states and actions in the game using the exploration methodology proposed in Go-Explore and then train a policy using a Seq2Seq BIBREF13 model that maps observations to actions, in an imitation learning fashion.

In the former experiment we show that Go-Explore finds winning trajectories faster than existing solutions, and in the latter, we show that training a Seq2Seq model on the trajectories found by Go-Explore results in stronger generalization, as suggested by the stronger performance on unseen games, compared to existing competitive baselines BIBREF10, BIBREF7.', 'In this paper we presented a novel methodology for solving text-based games which first extracts high-performing trajectories using phase 1 of Go-Explore and then trains a simple Seq2Seq model that maps observations to actions using the extracted trajectories. Our experiments show promising results in three settings, with improved generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing methods. Finally, we discussed the limitations and possible improvements of our methodology, which leads to new research challenges in text-based games.', 'Since the actions in these games are commands that are in natural language form, the major obstacle is the extremely large action space of the agent, which leads to a combinatorially large exploration problem. In fact, with a vocabulary of $N$ words (e.g. 20K) and the possibility of producing sentences with at most $m$ words (e.g. 7 words), the total number of actions is $O(N^m)$ (e.g. 20K$^7 \\approx 1.28 e^{30}$). To avoid this large action space, several existing solutions focus on simpler text-based games with very small vocabularies where the action space is constrained to verb-object pairs BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9. Moreover, many existing works rely on using predetermined sets of admissible actions BIBREF10, BIBREF11, BIBREF12. However, a more ideal, and still under explored, alternative would be an agent that can operate in the full, unconstrained action space of natural language that can systematically generalize to new text-based games with no or few interactions with the environment.', 'It is worth noting that a hand-tailored solution for the CookingWorld games has been proposed in the “First TextWorld Problems” competition BIBREF3. This solution managed to obtain up to 91.9% of the maximum possible score across the 514 test games on an unpublished dataset. However, this solution relies on entity extraction and template filling, which we believe limits its potential for generalization. Therefore, this approach should be viewed as complementary rather than competitor to our approach as it could potentially be used as an alternative way of getting promising trajectories.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1928251121076233,0.3831398406130078,100.00000000000004,0.0564826700898588,0.4301596102427684,1.0,"

The published results were acquired from the respective original publication (the reference publication is indicated in the respective tables). For the comparison we utilized benchmark datasets that include ironic, sarcastic and metaphoric expressions. Namely, we used the dataset provided in “Semantic Evaluation Workshop Task 3” (SemEval-2018) that contains ironic tweets BIBREF95; Riloff’s high quality sarcastic unbalanced dataset BIBREF96; a large dataset containing political comments from Reddit BIBREF97; and a SA dataset that contains tweets with various FL forms from “SemEval-2015 Task 11” BIBREF66. All datasets are used in a binary classification manner (i.e., irony/sarcasm vs. literal), except from the “SemEval-2015 Task 11” dataset where the task is to predict a sentiment integer score (from -5 to 5) for each tweet (refer to BIBREF0 for more details). The evaluation was made across standard five metrics namely, Accuracy (Acc), Precision (Pre), Recall (Rec), F1-score (F1), and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC). For the SA task the cosine similarity metric (Cos) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics are used, as proposed in the original study BIBREF66.', 'Although the NLP community have researched all aspects of FL independently, none of the proposed systems were evaluated on more than one type. Related work on FL detection and classification tasks could be categorized into two main categories, according to the studied task: (a) irony and sarcasm detection, and (b) sentiment analysis of FL excerpts. Even if sarcasm and irony are not identical phenomenons, we will present those types together, as they appear in the literature.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1700404858299595,0.3604922725199744,100.00000000000004,0.2027027027027027,6.512310160308707,1.0,"
    Answer:
    (1) First, we identify three different forms in this paper: irony, sarcasm, and metaphor.
    
    (2) In this paper, figurative expressions, and especially ironic or sarcastic ones, are considered as a way of indirect denial.
    
    (3) From this point of view, the interpretation and ultimately identification of the indirect meaning involved in a passage does not entail the cancellation of the indirectly rejected message and its replacement with the intentionally implied message (as advocated in BIBREF26, BIBREF27).
    
    (4) On the contrary ironic/sarcastic expressions presupposes the processing of both the indirectly rejected and the implied message so that the difference between them can be identified.
    
    (5) This view differs from the assumption that irony and sarcasm involve only one interpretation BIBREF28, BIBREF29.
    
    (6) Holding that irony activates both grammatical / explicit as well as ironic / involved notions provides that irony will be more difficult to grasp than a non",5.244652233161521,0.9125475285171102

An alternative approach to follow would be to use statistical significance testing on the ability of the metrics to distinguish between the summarizers (similar to Rankel:2011). We studied the effectiveness of existing summarization evaluation metrics in the scientific text genre and proposed an alternative superior metric. Another extension of this work would be to evaluate automatic summarization evaluation in other genres of text (such as social media). Our proposed method only evaluates the content quality of the summary. Similar to most of existing summarization evaluation metrics, other qualities such as linguistic cohesion, coherence and readability are not captured by this method. Developing metrics that also incorporate these qualities is yet another future direction to follow.', 'Scientific summarization has attracted more attention recently (examples include works by abu2011coherent, qazvinian2013generating, and cohan2015scientific). Thus, it is important to study the validity of existing methodologies applied to the evaluation of news article summarization for this task. In particular, we raise the important question of how effective is Rouge, as an evaluation metric for scientific summarization? We answer this question by comparing Rouge scores with semi-manual evaluation score (Pyramid) in TAC 2014 scientific summarization dataset[1]. Results reveal that, contrary to the common belief, correlations between Rouge and the Pyramid scores are weak, which challenges its effectiveness for scientific summarization. Furthermore, we show a large variance of correlations between different Rouge variants and the manual evaluations which further makes the reliability of Rouge for evaluating scientific summaries less clear. We then propose an evaluation metric based on relevance analysis of summaries which aims to overcome the limitation of high lexical dependence in Rouge. We call our metric Sera (Summarization Evaluation by Relevance Analysis). Results show that the proposed metric achieves higher and more consistent correlations with semi-manual assessment scores.', 'We provided an analysis of existing evaluation metrics for scientific summarization with evaluation of all variants of Rouge. We showed that Rouge may not be the best metric for summarization evaluation; especially in summaries with high terminology variations and paraphrasing (e.g. scientific summaries). Furthermore, we showed that different variants of Rouge result in different correlation values with human judgments, indicating that not all Rouge scores are equally effective. Among all variants of Rouge, Rouge-2 and Rouge-3 are better correlated with manual judgments in the context of scientific summarization.

Measures the disagreement between heads: the higher the value, the more the heads are disagreeing with each other in terms of where to attend. Models using sparse entmax have more diverse attention than the softmax baseline.', 'We report test set tokenized BLEU BIBREF32 results in Table TABREF27. We can see that replacing softmax by entmax does not hurt performance in any of the datasets; indeed, sparse attention Transformers tend to have slightly higher BLEU, but their sparsity leads to a better potential for analysis. In the next section, we make use of this potential by exploring the learned internal mechanics of the self-attention heads.', 'Figure 4: Distribution of attention densities (average number of tokens receiving non-zero attention weight) for all attention heads and all validation sentences. When compared to 1.5-entmax, α-entmax distributes the sparsity in a more uniform manner, with a clear mode at fully dense attentions, corresponding to the heads with low α.

    The proposed regularizer can improve the performance of both the encoder and the decoder by enforcing the learned weights to follow certain constraints. The encoder is composed of two components: the recurrent encoder and the convolutional encoder. The recurrent encoder is a stack of bi-directional LSTMs, while the convolutional encoder is a stack of bidirectional CNNs. The recurrent encoder is used to learn the contextual representation of the input sentence, while the convolutional encoder is used to capture the local information of the input sentence.

            Question: What do they do to handle rare/unseen words?

            Answer: Much of the work in NMT has been focused on the improvement of the encoder and the decoder, with little attention paid to the rest of the pipeline. In our model, we have noted that the attention component is the one most affected by the trade-off between regularization and the need for translation flexibility. At our best, we have managed to keep the perplexity over the validation set above $1,000$, a value commonly considered to indicate overfitting. To mitigate this, we have tried to regularize the attention weights by using a regressive objective to encourage the model to pay more attention to the least-attended words, as observed in human translations.

The model uses a bidirectional LSTM BIBREF44 for the encoder and a unidirectional LSTM for the decoder, with two layers each. The size of the word embeddings was set to 300d and that of the sentence embeddings to 512d. The sizes of the hidden vectors of both LSTMs and of the attention network were set to 1024d. In turn, the LSTM's dropout rate was set to $0.2$ and the training batch size was set to 40 sentences. As optimizer, we have used Adam BIBREF45 with a learning rate of $0.001$.

Both the encoder and the decoder are formed by a 6-layer network.

As we can see, only applying soft training without adaptation (Self-Train) hurts the performance. With the additional output layer (Dual-Train), the performance can be greatly improved over the baseline. Moreover, with the proposed method the simple baseline model is second to the best compared with the state-of-the-art models and even surpasses in ROUGE-2. It is promising that applying the proposed method to the state-of-the-art model could also improve its performance. The automatic evaluation is done on the original test set to facilitate comparison with existing work. However, a more reasonable setting would be to exclude the 52 test instances that are found bad in the human evaluation, because the quality of the automatic evaluation depends on the reference summary. As the existing methods do not provide their test output, it is a non-trivial task to reproduce all their results of the same reported performance. Nonetheless, it does not change the fact that ROUGE cannot handle the issues in abstractive text summarization properly.', 'We propose a regularization approach for the sequence-to-sequence model on the Chinese social media summarization task. In the proposed approach, we use a cross-entropy based regularization term to make the model neglect the possible unrelated words. We propose two methods for obtaining the soft output word distribution used in the regularization, of which Dual-Train proves to be more effective. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the semantic consistency by 4% in terms of human evaluation. As shown by the analysis, the proposed method achieves the improvements by eliminating the less semantically-related word correspondence. The proposed human evaluation method is effective and efficient in judging the semantic consistency, which is absent in previous work but is crucial in the accurate evaluation of the text summarization systems. The proposed metric is simple to conduct and easy to interpret. It also provides an insight on how practicable the existing systems are in the real-world scenario.', 'First, we show the results for human evaluation, which focuses on the semantic consistency of the summary with its source content. We evaluate the systems implemented by us as well as the reference. We cannot conduct human evaluations for the existing systems from other work, because the output summaries needed are not available for us. Besides, the baseline system we implemented is very competitive in terms of ROUGE and achieves better performance than almost all the existing systems. The results are listed in Table TABREF24 . It is surprising to see that the accuracy of the reference summaries does not reach 100%. It means that the test set still contains text-summary pairs of poor quality even after removing the pairs with relevance scores lower than 3 as suggested by the authors of the dataset. As we can see, Dual-Train improves the accuracy by 4%. Due to the rigorous definition of being good, the results mean that 4% more of the summaries are semantically consistent with their source content. However, Self-Train has a performance drop compared to the baseline. After investigating its generated summaries, we find that the major reason is that the generated summaries are not grammatically complete and often stop too early, although the generated part is indeed more related to the source content. Because the definition of being good, the improved relevance does not make up the loss on intelligibility.', 'We evaluate the proposed approach on the Chinese social media text summarization task, based on the sequence-to-sequence model. We also analyze the output text and the output label distribution of the models, showing the power of the proposed approach. Finally, we show the cases where the correspondences learned by the proposed approach are still problematic, which can be explained based on the approach we adopt.', 'To gain a better understanding of the results, we analyze the summaries generated by the baseline model and our proposed model. Some of the summaries are listed in Table TABREF28 . As shown in the table, the summaries generated by the proposed method are much better than the baseline, and we believe they are more precise and informative than the references. In the first one, the baseline system generates a grammatical but unrelated summary, while the proposed method generates a more informative summary. In the second one, the baseline system generates a related but ungrammatical summary, while the proposed method generates a summary related to the source content but different from the reference. We believe the generated summary is actually better than the reference because the focus of the visit is not the event itself but its purpose. In the third one, the baseline system generates a related and grammatical summary, but the facts stated are completely incorrect. The summary generated by the proposed method is more comprehensive than the reference, while the reference only includes the facts in the last sentence of the source content. In short, the generated summary of the proposed method is more consistent with the source content. It also exhibits the necessity of the proposed human evaluation. Because when the generated summary is evaluated against the reference, it may seem redundant or wrong, but it is actually true to the source content. While it is arguable that the generated summary is better than the reference, there is no doubt that the generated summary of the proposed method is better than the baseline. However, the improvement cannot be properly shown by the existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, the examples suggest that the proposed method does learn better correspondence. The highlighted words in each example in Table TABREF28 share almost the same previous words. However, in the first one, the baseline considers “UTF8gbsn停” (stop) as the most related words, which is a sign of noisy word relations learned from other training examples, while the proposed method generates “UTF8gbsn进站” (to the platform), which is more related to what a human thinks. It is the same with the second example, where a human selects “UTF8gbsn专家” (expert) and Dual-Train selects “UTF8gbsn工作者” (worker), while the baseline selects “UTF8gbsn钻研” (research) and fails to generate a grammatical sentence later. In the third one, the reference and the baseline use the same word, while Dual-Train chooses a word of the same meaning. It can be concluded that Dual-Train indeed learns better word relations that could generalize to the test set, and good word relations can guide the decoder to generate semantically consistent summaries.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,100.00000000000004,0.0,0.0,1.0,"

Another problem for abstractive text summarization is that the system summary cannot be easily evaluated automatically. ROUGE BIBREF9 is widely used for summarization evaluation. However, as ROUGE is designed for extractive text summarization, it cannot deal with summary paraphrasing in abstractive text summarization. Besides, as ROUGE is based on the reference, it requires high-quality reference summary for a reasonable evaluation, which is also lacking in the existing dataset for Chinese social media text summarization. We argue that for proper evaluation of text generation task, human evaluation cannot be avoided. We propose a simple and practical human evaluation for evaluating text summarization, where the summary is evaluated against the source content instead of the reference. It handles both of the problems of paraphrasing and lack of high-quality reference. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:', 'For text summarization, a common automatic evaluation method is ROUGE BIBREF9 . The generated summary is evaluated against the reference summary, based on unigram recall (ROUGE-1), bigram recall (ROUGE-2), and recall of longest common subsequence (ROUGE-L).

However, for abstractive text summarization, the ROUGE is sub-optimal, and cannot assess the semantic consistency between the summary and the source content, especially when there is only one reference for a piece of text. The reason is that the same content may be expressed in different ways with different focuses. Simple word match cannot recognize the paraphrasing. It is the case for all of the existing large-scale datasets. Besides, as aforementioned, ROUGE is calculated on the character level in Chinese text summarization, making the metrics favor the models on the character level in practice. In Chinese, a word is the smallest semantic element that can be uttered in isolation, not a character. In the extreme case, the generated text could be completely intelligible, but the characters could still match. In theory, calculating ROUGE metrics on the word level could alleviate the problem. However, word segmentation is also a non-trivial task for Chinese. There are many kinds of segmentation rules, which will produce different ROUGE scores. We argue that it is not acceptable to introduce additional systematic bias in automatic evaluations, and automatic evaluation for semantically related tasks can only serve as a reference. To avoid the deficiencies, we propose a simple human evaluation method to assess the semantic consistency. Each summary candidate is evaluated against the text rather than the reference. If the candidate is irrelevant or incorrect to the text, or the candidate is not understandable, the candidate is labeled bad. Otherwise, the candidate is labeled good. Then, we can get an accuracy of the good summaries. The proposed evaluation is very simple and straight-forward. It focuses on the relevance between the summary and the text.

In the human evaluation, the text-summary pairs are dispatched to two human annotators who are native speakers of Chinese.

To decrease the workload and get a hint about the annotation quality at the same time, we adopt the following procedure. We first randomly select 100 pairs in the validation set for the two human annotators to evaluate. Each pair is annotated twice, and the inter-annotator agreement is checked. We find that under the protocol, the inter-annotator agreement is quite high. In the evaluation of the test set, a pair is only annotated once to accelerate evaluation.

As we can see, only applying soft training without adaptation (Self-Train) hurts the performance. With the additional output layer (Dual-Train), the performance can be greatly improved over the baseline. Moreover, with the proposed method the simple baseline model is second to the best compared with the state-of-the-art models and even surpasses in ROUGE-2. It is promising that applying the proposed method to the state-of-the-art model could also improve its performance. The automatic evaluation is done on the original test set to facilitate comparison with existing work. However, a more reasonable setting would be to exclude the 52 test instances that are found bad in the human evaluation, because the quality of the automatic evaluation depends on the reference summary. As the existing methods do not provide their test output, it is a non-trivial task to reproduce all their results of the same reported performance.

Both the encoder and the decoder are supposed to support multiple languages. Following BIBREF5, we use language tag embeddings to distinguish the source and target languages. Given a sentence and its corresponding language tag, Xnlg encodes the input into vector representations. By conditioning on the encoding vectors and a specific language tag, the decoder generates the output sequence in the target language. Figure FIGREF6 illustrates the pre-training objectives and the pre-training protocol designed for Xnlg.', 'If only DAE is used as the pre-training task for the decoder, we found that the model ignores the target language tag while generating just the same language as the input, caused by the spurious correlation issue BIBREF25. In other words, the DAE loss captures the spurious correlation between the source language tag and the target sentences, but we expect the language of generated sentences can be controlled by the target language tag. To solve the above problem, we use machine translation as the cross-lingual auto-encoding (XAE) task, which decreases mutual information between the target sentences and the source language tag. XAE can be viewed as the multilingual-version DAE task in the sense that both of them recover the sentence by conditioning on the encoded representations. The cross-lingual auto-encoding loss is defined as: XAE(x,y) = -p(y|x) - p(x|y) where $(x,y)$ is a pair of sentences in the parallel corpus.', 'For fine-tuning on downstream NLG tasks, we use Adam optimizer with a learning rate of $5\\times 10^{-6}$.

During decoding, we use beam search with beam size of 3, and limit the length of the target sequence to 80 tokens.', 'Although the pre-trained encoder in the first stage enables the model to encode multilingual sentences. However, it cannot directly be used in cross-lingual NLG because: 1) encoder-decoder attention is not pre-trained; 2) the decoding algorithm is different between masked language modeling and autoregressive decoding, resulting in the mismatch between pre-training and fine-tuning.

To this end, we design a type-based method for obtaining a suitable reference summary $y^{\\prime }$ via retrieving another table-summary from the training data using $x$ and $y_{aux}$.

We use an existing information extraction tool BIBREF10 to extract record types from the reference text. Table TABREF3 shows the statistics of constructed document-level dataset and a sentence-level benchmark dataset BIBREF1. We can see that the proposed document-level text manipulation problem is more difficult than sentence-level, both in terms of the complexity of input records and the length of generated text.', 'To verify the effectiveness of our text manipulation approaches, we first build a large unsupervised document-level text manipulation dataset, which is extracted from an NBA game report corpus BIBREF10. Experiments of different methods on this new corpus show that our full model achieves 35.02 in Style BLEU and 39.47 F-score in Content Selection, substantially better than baseline methods. Moreover, a comprehensive evaluation with human judgment demonstrates that integrating interactive attention and back-translation could improve the content fidelity and style preservation of summary by a basic text editing model. In the end, we conduct extensive experiments on a sentence-level text manipulation dataset BIBREF1. Empirical results also show that the proposed approach achieves a new state-of-the-art result.', 'In this paper, we first introduce a new yet practical problem, named document-level text content manipulation, which aims to express given structured recordset with a paragraph text and mimic the writing style of a reference text. Afterwards, we construct a corresponding dataset and develop a neural model for this task with hierarchical record encoder and interactive attention mechanism. In addition, we optimize the previous training strategy with back-translation. Finally, empirical results verify that the presented approaches perform substantively better than several popular data-to-text generation and style transfer methods on both constructed document-level dataset and a sentence-level dataset. In the future, we plan to integrate neural-based retrieval methods into our model for further improving results.', 'We use two-layers LSTMs in all encoders and decoders, and employ attention mechanism BIBREF19. Trainable model parameters are randomly initialized under a Gaussian distribution. We set the hyperparameters empirically based on multiple tries with different settings. We find the following setting to be the best. The dimension of word/feature embedding, encoder hidden state, and decoder hidden state are all set to be 600. We apply dropout at a rate of 0.3. Our training process consists of three parts. In the first, we set $\\lambda _1=0$ and $\\lambda _2=1$ in Eq. 7 and pre-train the model to convergence. We then set $\\lambda _1=0.5$ and $\\lambda _2=0.5$ for the next stage training. Finally, we set $\\lambda _1=0.4$ and $\\lambda _2=0.5$ for full training.

    Question: What is their main contribution?

    Paper passages:

    The main contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the core structure of a monotonicity operator differs in its linguistic properties from the core structure of non-monotonic operators. Thus, by combining the linguistic properties of core structures with the syntactic structure of the sentence, we can detect whether an inference is entailed by a given context with a high accuracy of 90.4% (for a gold standard test set of 6579 sentences).

            Dear <u>Kenneth</u>,

            Thank you for your interest in the paper!

            In terms of evaluation metrics, the metrics used were those proposed by the organisers. These were a combination of confusion matrix and prior knowledge (i.e. the difficulty of the topic). The evaluation metrics used were:

            Precision = 100 * (TP / (TP + FP + FN))

            Recall = 100 * (TP / (TP + FN))

            Accuracy = 100 * (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

            F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

            I must say, that the paper passages do not mention the topic of the essay, so that this is not something that the system had to deal with.

            Overall, the system performed very well in the CAp challenge with an accuracy of 98.2%. It is important to note that the performance of the system was not affected by the actual topic of the essay, but rather","['1809.08935-Problem Definition-0', '1809.08935-Conclusion-0', '1809.08935-Problem Definition-1', '1809.08935-4-Table3-1.png', '1809.08935-Conclusion-1']","['In order to approach the language-level prediction task as a supervised classification problem, I frame it as an ordinal classification problem. In particular, given a written essay INLINEFORM0 from a candidate, the goal is to associate the essay with the level INLINEFORM1 of English according to the Common European Framework of Reference for languages (CEFR) system. Under CEFR there are six language levels INLINEFORM2 , such that INLINEFORM3 . In this notation, INLINEFORM4 is the beginner level while INLINEFORM5 is the most advanced level.

The first thing to note is that the model makes better use of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH or COREF connections. This is mostly because i) the majority of the connections are indeed between mentions in the same document, and ii) without connecting mentions within the same document we remove important information since the model is unaware they appear closely in the document. Secondly, we notice that coreference links and complement edges seem to play a more marginal role. Though it may be surprising for coreference edges, recall that the MATCH heuristic already captures the easiest coreference cases, and for the rest the out-of-domain coreference system may not be reliable. Still, modelling all these different relations together gives our Entity-GCN a clear advantage. This is our best system evaluating on the development. Since Entity-GCN seems to gain little advantage using the coreference system, we report test results both with and without using it. Surprisingly, with coreference, we observe performance degradation on the test set.

We first introduce the dataset we focus on, WikiHop by BIBREF0 , as well as the task abstraction. We then present the building blocks that make up our Entity-GCN model, namely, an entity graph used to relate mentions to entities within and across documents, a document encoder used to obtain representations of mentions in context, and a relational graph convolutional network that propagates information through the entity graph.', 'In previous work, BiDAF BIBREF3 , FastQA BIBREF6 , Coref-GRU BIBREF12 , MHPGM BIBREF11 , and Weaver / Jenga BIBREF10 have been applied to multi-document question answering. The first two mainly focus on single document QA and BIBREF0 adapted both of them to work with WikiHop. They process each instance of the dataset by concatenating all $d \\in S_q$ in a random order adding document separator tokens. They trained using the first answer mention in the concatenated document and evaluating exact match at test time. Coref-GRU, similarly to us, encodes relations between entity mentions in the document. Instead of using graph neural network layers, as we do, they augment RNNs with jump links corresponding to pairs of corefereed mentions. MHPGM uses a multi-attention mechanism in combination with external commonsense relations to perform multiple hops of reasoning. Weaver is a deep co-encoding model that uses several alternating bi-LSTMs to process the concatenated documents and the query.', 'In this experiment we investigate the effect of the different relations available in the entity graph and processed by the R-GCN module.

The results suggest that WikipHop genuinely requires multihop inference, as our best model is 6.1% and 8.4% more accurate than this local model, in unmasked and masked settings, respectively.

It is not surprising as coreferred mentions are labeled with the same identifier in the masked version, even if their original surface forms did not match ( BIBREF0 used Wikipedia links for masking). Indeed, in the masked version, an entity is always referred to via the same unique surface form (e.g., MASK1) within and across documents. In the unmasked setting, on the other hand, mentions to an entity may differ (e.g., “US” vs “United States”) and they might not be retrieved by the coreference system we are employing, making the task harder for all models. Therefore, as we rely mostly on exact matching when constructing our graph for the masked case, we are more effective in recovering coreference links on the masked rather than unmasked version.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.3252595155709343,0.2573104492316774,100.00000000000004,0.10884353741496598,2.4043119513098916,1.0,"

In addition, “Mixed fine tuning” does not worsen the quality of out-of-domain translations, while “Fine tuning” and “Multi domain” do.

    Question: What is their model architecture?

    Paper passages:
    
    The architecture of our model is composed of two main components: a PCFG parser and a neural network classifier. The PCFG parser is used to encode the input sentence with a deep representation. The deep representation is then passed to the neural network classifier to predict the class label of the sentence.

    Answer:
    PCFG parser and neural network classifier.

    Question: How does the model work?

    Paper passages:

    The parser generates a sequence of hidden states, \(h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_T\) and a sequence of token labels, \(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_T\), where \(h_t\) is a hidden state vector at time step \(t\), and \(y_t\) is the token label at time step \(t\).

To assess relative performance of feature representations, we also include performance metrics of our models without MWEs. Because this is a multilabel classification task we use macro-averaging to compute precision, recall, and F1 scores for each paragraph in the testing set. In identifying domains individually, our models achieved the highest per-domain scores on Substance (F1 INLINEFORM0 0.8) and the lowest scores on Interpersonal and Mood (F1 INLINEFORM1 0.5). We observe a consistency in per-domain performance rankings between our MLP and RBF models.', 'Overall agreement was generally good and aligned almost exactly with the IAA on the first domain only. Out of the 1,654 annotated paragraphs, 671 (41%) had total agreement across all three annotators. We defined total agreement for the task as a set-theoretic complete intersection of domains for a paragraph identified by all annotators. 98% of paragraphs in total agreement involved one domain. Only 35 paragraphs had total disagreement, which we defined as a set-theoretic null intersection between the three annotators. An analysis of the 35 paragraphs with total disagreement showed that nearly 30% included the term “blunted/restricted"". In clinical terminology, these terms can be used to refer to appearance, affect, mood, or emotion. Because the paragraphs being annotated were extracted from larger clinical narratives and examined independently of any surrounding context, it was difficult for the annotators to determine the most appropriate domain. This lack of contextual information resulted in each annotator using a different `default\' label: Appearance, Mood, and Other. During adjudication, Other was decided as the most appropriate label unless the paragraph contained additional content that encompassed other domains, as it avoids making unnecessary assumptions.

We can see in Figure FIGREF10 that Thought Process, Appearance, Substance, and – to a certain extent – Occupation clearly occupy specific regions, whereas Interpersonal, Mood, and Thought Content occupy the same noisy region where multiple domains overlap. Given that similarity is computed using Euclidean distance in an RBF network, it is difficult to accurately classify paragraphs that fall in regions occupied by multiple risk factor domain clusters since prototype centroids from the risk factor domains will overlap and be less differentiable. This is confirmed by the results in Table TABREF9 , where the differences in performance between the RBF and MLP models are more pronounced in the three overlapping domains (0.496 vs 0.448 for Interpersonal, 0.530 vs 0.496 for Mood, and 0.721 vs 0.678 for Thought Content) compared to the non-overlapping domains (0.564 vs 0.566 for Appearance, 0.592 vs 0.598 for Occupation, 0.797 vs 0.792 for Substance, and 0.635 vs 0.624 for Thought Process). We also observe a similarity in the words and phrases with the highest TF-IDF scores across the overlapping domains: many of the Thought Content words and phrases with the highest TF-IDF scores involve interpersonal relations (e.g. `fear surrounding daughter', `father', `family history', `familial conflict') and there is a high degree of similarity between high-scoring words for Mood (e.g. `meets anxiety criteria', `cope with mania', `ocd'[8]) and Thought Content (e.g. `mania', `feels anxious', `feels exhausted')."", 'Starting with the approach taken by McCoy et al. mccoy2015clinical, who used aggregate cosine similarity scores to compute domain similarity directly from their TF-IDF vector space model, we extend this method by training a suite of three-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) neural networks using a variety of parameters to compare performance. We employ the Keras deep learning library BIBREF21 using a TensorFlow backend BIBREF22 for this task. The architectures of our highest performing MLP and RBF models are summarized in Table TABREF7 . Prototype vectors for the nodes in the hidden layer of our RBF model are selected via k-means clustering BIBREF23 on each domain paragraph megadocument individually.

    Question: How does their approach change from the traditional approach of generating all the possible candidates?

    Paper passages:
    To address the problem of generating candidate sentences, we propose a novel approach that jointly trains a neural model and a candidate-selection model. Similar to previous work, our approach starts from a candidate pool of size ‘n’ where ‘n’ is the length of the sentence. However, instead of generating all possible candidates, our approach only generates (n+1) candidates. As shown in Figure 1, for each candidate X1, we first learn a candidate-selection network C with a softmax layer to predict the probability of the candidate being selected. We then learn a neural model M to predict the probability of the candidate X1 generating the correct answer. The whole process is conducted in an end-to-end manner.

At each iteration of adversarial training, we first train the discriminator to assign higher rewards to real data than to generated samples. Then, inspired by reward augmented maximum likelihood (RAML) BIBREF17 , the generator is updated on the samples acquired from a stationary distribution with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), weighted by the discriminator's rewards. This stationary distribution is designed to guarantee that training samples are surrounding the real data, thus the exploration space of our generator is indeed restricted by the MLE training objective, resulting in more stable training. Compared to other text GANs with RL training techniques, our framework acquires samples from the stationary distribution rather than the generator's distribution, and uses RAML training paradigm to optimize the generator instead of policy gradient.

This makes our final system easy to deploy as it is a simple ensemble of standard neural models with minimal preprocessing (subword segmentation). Our contributions on this track focus on NMT training techniques such as over-sampling, back-translation, and fine-tuning. We show that over-sampling effectively reduces domain mismatch. We found back-translation BIBREF5 to be a very effective technique to utilize unannotated training data. However, while over-sampling is commonly used in machine translation to balance the number of real and back-translated training sentences, we report that using over-sampling this way for GEC hurts performance.

Since this task requires assembling and summarizing information from multiple relevant documents in contrast to a single sentence/paragraph, therefore, it is more challenging than the existing single-hop QG task. Further, the presence of irrelevant information makes it difficult to capture the supporting facts required for question generation.

    We propose a novel neural framework that can help the model better predict supporting facts from the documents and improve the quality of generated questions. A few-shot learning method is used to train the supporting facts prediction network. The network model is trained on a small number of documents to learn the representation of supporting facts in the given documents. The trained supporting facts prediction network is then used to predict supporting facts for given documents. We study the effectiveness of the proposed method on the HotPotQA dataset. We also conduct human evaluation to evaluate the quality of the generated questions. Our experiments show that our proposed method is able to improve the quality of generated questions without significantly increasing the training time.

This is important for downstream tasks, which rely on trade-offs between the precision and recall of extracted assertions. For instance, an open IE-powered medical question answering (QA) system may require its assertions in higher precision (and consequently lower recall) than QA systems for other domains. For supervised open IE systems, the confidence score of an assertion is typically computed based on its extraction likelihood given by the model BIBREF3 , BIBREF5 . However, we observe that this often yields sub-optimal ranking results, with incorrect extractions of one sentence having higher likelihood than correct extractions of another sentence. We hypothesize this is due to the issue of a disconnect between training and test-time objectives. Specifically, the system is trained solely to raise likelihood of gold-standard extractions, and during training the model is not aware of its test-time behavior of ranking a set of system-generated assertions across sentences that potentially include incorrect extractions.', 'Compared to using external models for confidence modeling, an advantage of the proposed method is that the base model does not change: the binary classification loss just provides additional supervision. Ideally, the resulting model after one-round of training becomes better not only at confidence modeling, but also at assertion generation, suggesting that extractions of higher quality can be added as training samples to continue this training process iteratively.

When the passengers give instructions to AMIE, the agent should parse such commands properly considering available three modalities (language/text, audio, video) and trigger the appropriate functionality of the AV system.

These knowledge extraction tools are designed to extract semantic relations from English sentences that capture the meaning. The limitations of these tools are two-fold: first, they lack sufficient accuracy to extract the correct semantic relations and entities while KRR is very sensitive to incorrect data; second, these systems are not able to map the semantic relations to logical forms and therefore not capable of doing KRR.

The first two belong to end-to-end learning approaches based on machine learning models. The last two systems have implemented semantic parsers which translate natural language sentences into intermediate query languages and then query the knowledge base to get the answers. For the machine learning based approaches, the results are not explainable. Besides, their accuracy is not high enough to provide correct answers.

The machine learning model persists itself by storing its weights to disk and loading from it while retraining or reinforcing itself to learn from mistakes. The tweets and cryptocurrency training data is also stored in Apache Hive which provides data warehousing support to read, write and manage distributed datasets directly from disk. This persistence technique helps the whole platform to reset itself without omissions in real time.', 'An important element of our architecture is the machine learning model, trained to capture the correlation between social media sentiment and a certain metric of the financial market, in our case, the price of cryptocurrency. An essential characteristic of the model is that it should be able to continuously evolve and adjust its weights according to the ever-changing social media sentiments and the volatile cryptocurrency market. We discuss later how we incorporate this in our model design. However, it is worth mentioning that our problem deals with structured data with features related to the social media sentiments and primitive or computed metrics of the cryptocurrency market.', 'KryptoOracle has been built in the Apache ecosystem and uses Apache Spark. Data structures in Spark are based on resilient distributed datasets (RDD), a read only multi-set of data which can be distributed over a cluster of machines and is fault tolerant. Spark applications run as separate processes on different clusters and are coordinated by the Spark object also referred to as the SparkContext. This element is the main driver of the program which connects with the cluster manager and helps acquire executors on different nodes to allocate resource across applications. Spark is highly scalable, being 100x faster than Hadoop on large datasets, and provides out of the box libraries for both streaming and machine learning.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.4465408805031446,0.4597761894981448,100.00000000000004,0.13414634146341461,0.8817552836601144,1.0,"

In Peters et al . BIBREF0 , the authors compare the possibility of option stack-only and finetune-only, and conclude that option finetune-only is better than option stack-only. More specifically, Peter et al. BIBREF0 argue that it is better to add a task-specific head on top of BERT than to freeze the weights of BERT and add more complex network structures. However, Peters et al. BIBREF0 did not compare option stack-and-finetune and finetune-only. On the other hand, before pre-trained deep language models became popular, researchers often use a strategy analog to option stack-and-finetune. That is, modelers first train the model until convergence, and then fine-tune the word embeddings with a few epochs. If pre-trained language models can be understood as at least partially resemblance of word embeddings, then it will be imprudent not to consider the possibility of option stack-and-finetune.', ""In the presence of the success of pre-trained language models, especially BERT BIBREF1 , it is natural to ask how to best utilize the pre-trained language models to achieve new state-of-the-art results. In this line of work, Liu et al. BIBREF20 investigated the linguistic knowledge and transferability of contextual representations by comparing BERT BIBREF1 with ELMo BIBREF14 , and concluded that while the higher levels of LSTM's are more task-specific, this trend does not exhibit in transformer based models. Stickland and Murray BIBREF21 invented projected attention layer for multi-task learning using BERT, which results in an improvement in various state-of-the-art results compared to the original work of Devlin et al. BIBREF1 . Xu et al. BIBREF22 propose a “post-training” algorithms, which does not directly fine-tune BERT, but rather first “post-train” BERT on the task related corpus using the masked language prediction task next sentence prediction task, which helps to reduce the bias in the training corpus. Finally, Sun et al. BIBREF23 added additional fine-tuning tasks based on multi-task training, which further improves the prediction power of BERT in the tasks of text classification."", 'In this study, we aim to compare the strategy stack-and-finetune and strategy finetune-only. More specifically, we perform three NLP tasks, sequence labeling, text classification, and question similarity. In the first tasks, we demonstrate that even without modifying the network structures, building networks on top of pre-trained language models might improve accuracy. In the second tasks, we show that by ensembling different neural networks, one can even improve the accuracy of fine-tuning only methods even further. Finally, in the last task, we demonstrate that if one can tailor-made a neural network that specifically fit the characteristics of the pre-trained language models, one can improve the accuracy even further. All the results indicate the strategy stack-and-finetune is superior to strategy finetune-only. This leads us to conclude that, at least, by overlooking the possibility strategy stack-and-finetune is imprudent.', 'We find the ensembled model enjoys a 0.72% improvements compared to the fine-tune only model and 0.005 improvement for the F1 score.', 'The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we propose a new strategy to improve the fine-tune-only strategy proposed by Peter et al. BIBREF0 , this allows us to achieve better results, at least on the selected tasks. More importantly, the results of this study demonstrate the importance of neural networks design, even in the presence of all-powerful pre-trained language models. Second, during the experiment, we have found that although simply using the proposed training strategy can result in higher accuracies compared to that of Peter et al. BIBREF0 , it is still a challenging task to find the appropriate methods to design and to utilize pre-trained networks. In this regard, we find that pre-trained models differ significantly from word embeddings in terms of their training strategies. Especially, since word embeddings can be viewed as shallow transfer learning, while pre-trained model should be viewed as deep transfer learning, one must try to combat over-fitting problems with more care due to the enormous number of parameters presented in the pre-trained models. Besides, we also find that in order to achieve the maximal performance in the post-pre-trained language model era, one must design, either manually or via Auto ML, networks that best fit the structure, especially the depth of the pre-trained language models.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0717703349282296,0.0,100.00000000000004,0.07602339181286549,0.8037809658486403,1.0,"

    The second thing you need to know is that they used two different models: one was called BERT, which is a transformer-based model, and the other was called BIMPM, which is an attention-based model.

    The third thing you need to know is that they compared two different BERT-only models, which were called fine-tuning only and BIMPM.

Our approach, besides its generality, also outperforms a variety of dedicated rule- and learning-based methods for either augmentation or weighting, respectively. Lastly, we observe that the two types of manipulation tend to excel in different contexts: augmentation shows superiority over weighting with a small amount of data available, while weighting is better at addressing class imbalance problems.', 'We next study a different problem setting where the training data of different classes are imbalanced.

Interestingly, the augmentation tends to hinder model training and yields accuracy of around 50% (random guess). This is because the augmentation LM is first fit to the imbalanced data, which makes label preservation inaccurate and introduces lots of noise during augmentation. Though a more carefully designed augmentation mechanism can potentially help with imbalanced classification (e.g., augmenting only the rare classes), the above observation further shows that the varying data manipulation schemes have different applicable scopes.

Moreover, as we exposed our trolling definition, it is possible for commentators in a conversation to believe that they are witnessing a trolling event and respond accordingly even where there is none. Therefore, even in the comments that do not involve trolling, we are interested in learning what triggers users interpretation of trolling where it is not present and what kind of response strategies are used. We define as a suspected trolling event in our dataset a comment in which at least one of its children contains the word troll.', 'Inter-Annotator Agreement. Due to the subjective nature of the task we did not expected perfect agreement. However, we obtained substantial inter-annotator agreement as we measured the fleiss-kappa statistic BIBREF3 for each of the trolling aspects: Intention: 0.578, Intention Disclosure: 0.556, Interpretation: 0.731 and Response 0.632. After inspecting the dataset, we manually reconciled aspects of the threads that found no majority on the turkers annotation and verified and corrected consistency on the four tasks on each thread.', 'From the result table TABREF24 , we observe that hybrid model significantly outperform the baseline, by more than 20 points in intention and intention disclosure prediction. For the response strategy, it is clear that none of the systems offer satisfying results; this showcases the difficult of such a large number of classes. Nonetheless, the hybrid model outperforms the fully joint model and baseline in all but one the response strategy classes. However, the differences are far less impressive as in the other tasks. It is surprisingly; that the full joint model did not offered the best performance. One of the reasons behind this is that intention, intentions disclosure and interpretation tasks are hurt by the difficulty of learning parameters that maximize the response strategy, this last task drags the other three down in performance. Another reason is that, the features response strategy is not informative enough to learn the correct concept, and due to the joint inference process, all tasks receive a hit. Also, it is counter-intuitive that the augmented set of features did not outperform in all tasks but in intentions disclosure and interpretation, and just by a small margin. A reason explaining this unexpected behavior is that the majority of enhanced features are already represented in the basic feature set by means of the unigrams and bigrams, and the Framenet and Sentiment features are uninformative or redundant. Lastly, we observe that for interpretation category, none of systems were able to predict the “playing” class. This is because of the relative size of the number of instances annotated with that value, 1% of the entire dataset. We hypothesize those instances labeled by the annotators, of which a majority agreed on, incorrectly selected the playing category instead of the trolling class, and that, at the interpretation level, one can only expect to reliably differentiate between trolling and trolling.', ""We believe our work makes four contributions. First, unlike previous computational work on trolling, which focused primarily on analyzing the narrative retrospectively by the victim (e.g., determining the trolling type and the role played by each participant), we study trolling by analyzing comments in a conversation, aiming instead to identify trollers, who, once identified, could be banned from posting. Second, while previous work has focused on analyzing trolling from the troll's perspective, we additionally model trolling from the target's perspective, with the goal understanding the psychological impact of a trolling event on the target, which we believe is equally important from a practical standpoint. Third, we propose a comprehensive categorization of trolling that covers not only the troll's intention but also the victim and other commenters' reaction to the troll's comment. We believe such categorization will provide a solid basis on which future computational approaches to trolling can be built. Finally, we make our annotated data set consisting of 1000 annotated trolling events publicly available. We believe that our data set will be a valuable resource to any researcher interested in the computational modeling of trolling.""]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1193317422434367,0.1916313725240189,100.00000000000004,0.08633093525179857,0.7988355624959173,1.0," - The annotation was done in two stages:

In addition, we show that our approach to this feedback, the mimic loss framework, is useful in many scenarios: with and without the presence of parallel data, in both the enhancement and robust ASR scenarios. Using this framework, we show improvement on a state-of-the-art model for speech enhancement. The methodology is agnostic to the enhancement technique, so may be applicable to other differentiably trained enhancement modules.', 'Typical speech enhancement techniques focus on local criteria for improving speech intelligibility and quality. Time-frequency prediction techniques use local spectral quality estimates as an objective function; time domain methods directly predict clean output with a potential spectral quality metric BIBREF0. Such techniques have been extremely successful in predicting a speech denoising function, but also require parallel clean and noisy speech for training. The trained systems implicitly learn the phonetic patterns of the speech signal in the coordinated output of time-domain or time-frequency units. However, our hypothesis is that directly providing phonetic feedback can be a powerful additional signal for speech enhancement. For example, many local metrics will be more attuned to high-energy regions of speech, but not all phones of a language carry equal energy in production (compare /v/ to /ae/).', 'We first train this network without the use of parallel data, using only the senone targets, and starting from random weights in the AECNN. In Table TABREF8 we see results for enhancement without parallel data: the cross-entropy loss with senone targets given a frozen clean-speech network is enough to improve eSTOI by 4.3 points. This is a surprising improvement in intelligibility given the lack of parallel data, and demonstrates that phonetic information alone is powerful enough to provide improvements to speech intelligibility metrics. The degradation in SI-SDR performance, a measure of speech quality, is expected, given that the denoising model does not have access to clean data, and may corrupt the phase.', 'When no parallel data is available, but transcripts are available, a loss is easily computed against hard senone labels and backpropagated to the enhancement model trained from scratch. Since the clean acoustic model is frozen, the only way for the enhancement model to improve the loss is to make a signal that is more recognizable to the acoustic model. The improvement by this model demonstrates the power of phonetic feedback; very few neural enhancement techniques until now have been able to achieve improvements without parallel data.', 'Table 2.

Basically, it is known that location-based attention yields better performance than additive attention BIBREF10 . However, in the case of Japanese sentence, its length is much shorter than that of English sentence, which makes the use of location-based attention less effective. In most of the cases, the use of MHA brings the improvement of the recognition performance. Next, we focus on the effectiveness of our proposed MHD architecture. By comparing with the MHA-Loc, MHD-Loc (proposed method) improved the performance in Tasks 1 and 2, while we observed the degradation in Task 3. However, the heterogeneous extension (HMHD), as introduced in Section SECREF27 , brings the further improvement for the performance of MHD, achieving the best performance among all of the methods for all test sets.', 'The other approach utilizes attention-based method BIBREF7 . In this approach, encoder-decoder architecture BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 is used to perform a direct mapping from a sequence of input features into text. The encoder network converts the sequence of input features to that of discriminative hidden states, and the decoder network uses attention mechanism to get an alignment between each element of the output sequence and the encoder hidden states. And then it estimates the output symbol using weighted averaged hidden states, which is based on the alignment, as the inputs of the decoder network. Compared with the CTC-based approach, the attention-based method does not require any conditional independence assumptions including the Markov assumption, language models, and complex decoding. However, non-causal alignment problem is caused by a too flexible alignment of the attention mechanism BIBREF10 . To address this issue, the study BIBREF10 combines the objective function of the attention-based model with that of CTC to constrain flexible alignments of the attention. Another study BIBREF11 uses a multi-head attention (MHA) to get more suitable alignments. In MHA, multiple attentions are calculated, and then, they are integrated into a single attention. Using MHA enables the model to jointly focus on information from different representation subspaces at different positions BIBREF12 , leading to the improvement of the recognition performance.', 'As a further extension, we propose heterogeneous multi-head decoder (HMHD). Original MHA methods BIBREF12 , BIBREF11 use the same attention function such as dot-product or additive attention for each head.

Another advantage of DCA over GMM attention is that its attention weights are normalized, which helps to stabilize the alignment, especially for coarse-grained alignment tasks.', 'We have shown that Dynamic Convolution Attention (DCA) and our V2 GMM attention with initial bias (GMMv2b) are able to generalize to utterances much longer than those seen during training, while preserving naturalness on shorter utterances. This opens the door for synthesis of entire paragraph or long sentences (e.g., for book or news reading applications), which can improve naturalness and continuity compared to synthesizing each sentence or clause separately and then stitching them together.', ""In designing Dynamic Convolution Attention (DCA), we were motivated by location-relative mechanisms like GMM attention, but desired fully normalized attention weights. Despite the fact that GMM attention V1 and V2 use normalized mixture weights and components, the attention weights still end up unnormalized because they are sampled from a continuous probability density function. This can lead to occasional spikes or dropouts in the alignment, and attempting to directly normalize GMM attention weights results in unstable training. Attention normalization isn't a significant problem in fine-grained output-to-text alignment, but becomes more of an issue for coarser-grained alignment tasks where the attention window needs to gradually move to the next index (for example in variable-length prosody transfer applications BIBREF12). Because DCA is in the energy-based attention family, it is normalized by default and should work well for a variety of monotonic alignment tasks."", 'In our experiments we compare the GMM and additive energy-based families of attention mechanisms enumerated in Tables TABREF6 and TABREF9. We use the Tacotron architecture described in Section SECREF1 and only vary the attention function used to compute the attention weights, $\\mathbf {\\alpha }_i$. The decoder produces two 128-bin, 12.5ms-hop mel spectrogram frames per step. We train each model using the Adam optimizer for 300,000 steps with a gradient clipping threshold of 5 and a batch size of 256, spread across 32 Google Cloud TPU cores.

We show that GMM-based mechanisms are able to generalize to very long (potentially infinite-length) utterances, and we introduce simple modifications that result in improved speed and consistency of alignment during training.

This adaptation treats the dependent arguments as argument spans of length 1. Additionally, BIO consistency constraints are removed from the original model— each token is tagged simply with the argument label or an empty tag. A similar approach has also been proposed by marcheggiani2017lstm.', 'The input to the model consists of a sequence of pretrained embeddings for the surface forms of the sentence tokens. Each token embedding is also concatenated with a vector indicating whether the word is a predicate or not. Since the part-of-speech tags in the CoNLL 2009 dataset are based on a different tagset for each language, we do not use these. Each training instance consists of the annotations for a single predicate. These representations are then passed through a deep, multi-layer bidirectional LSTM BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 with highway connections BIBREF6 .', 'We use the hidden representations produced by the deep biLSTM for both argument labeling and predicate sense disambiguation in a multitask setup; this is a modification to the models of He2017-deepsrl, who did not handle predicate senses, and of marcheggiani2017lstm, who used a separate model. These two predictions are made independently, with separate softmaxes over different last-layer parameters; we then combine the losses for each task when training. For predicate sense disambiguation, since the predicate has been identified, we choose from a small set of valid predicate senses as the tag for that token. This set of possible senses is selected based on the training data: we map from lemmatized tokens to predicates and from predicates to the set of all senses of that predicate. Most predicates are only observed to have one or two corresponding senses, making the set of available senses at test time quite small (less than five senses/predicate on average across all languages). If a particular lemma was not observed in training, we heuristically predict it as the first sense of that predicate. For Czech and Japanese, the predicate sense annotation is simply the lemmatized token of the predicate, giving a one-to-one predicate-“sense” mapping.', 'We use pretrained word embeddings as input to the model. For each of the shared task languages, we produced GloVe vectors BIBREF7 from the news, web, and Wikipedia text of the Leipzig Corpora Collection BIBREF8 .

Coh-Metrix is a tool for producing linguistic and discourse representations of a text. As a result of applying the Coh-Metrix to the input documents, we have 108 indices related to text statistics, such as the number of words and sentences; referential cohesion, which refers to overlap in content words between sentences; various text readability formulas; different types of connective words and more. To account for multicollinearity among the different features, we first run a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the set of Coh-Metrix indices. Note that we do not apply dimensionality reduction, such that the features still correspond to the Coh-Metrix indices and are thus explainable. Then, we use the PCA scores as independent variables in a logistic regression model with the fake and satire labels as our dependent variable. Significant features of the logistic regression model are shown in Table TABREF3 with the respective significance levels. We also run a step-wise backward elimination regression. Those components that are also significant in the step-wise model appear in bold.', 'For future work, we plan to study additional linguistic cues, and specifically humor related features, such as absurdity and incongruity, which were shown to be good indicators of satire in previous work. Another interesting line of research would be to investigate techniques of identifying whether a story carries a political or social message, for example, by comparing it with timely news information.', 'We addressed the challenge of identifying nuances between fake news and satire. Inspired by the humor and social message aspects of satire articles, we tested two classification approaches based on a state-of-the-art contextual language model, and linguistic features of textual coherence. Evaluation of our methods pointed to the existence of semantic and linguistic differences between fake news and satire. In particular, both methods achieved a significantly better performance than the baseline language-based method. Lastly, we studied the feature importance of our linguistic-based method to help shed light on the nuances between fake news and satire. For instance, we observed that satire articles are more sophisticated, or less easy to read, than fake news articles.', 'To investigate the predictive power of the linguistic cues, we use those Coh-Metrix indices that were significant in both the logistic and step-wise backward elimination regression models, and train a classifier on fake news and satire articles. We tested a few classification models, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and gradient boosting - among which the SVM classifier gave the best results.', ""Observing the significant features, in bold in Table TABREF3, we see a combination of surface level related features, such as sentence length and average word frequency, as well as semantic features including LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) overlaps between verbs and between adjacent sentences. Semantic features which are associated with the gist representation of content are particularly interesting to see among the predictors since based on Fuzzy-trace theory BIBREF13, a well-known theory of decision making under risk, gist representation of content drives individual's decision to spread misinformation online. Also among the significant features, we observe the causal connectives, that are proven to be important in text comprehension, and two indices related to the text easability and readability, both suggesting that satire articles are more sophisticated, or less easy to read, than fake news articles.""]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1828571428571428,0.7501908993821859,100.00000000000004,0.032520325203252036,0.4929289023181267,1.0," - This paper refers to two indices, but it uses only one of them - a logistic regression model with a SVM classifier (feature: variable).

    Question: How does the paper define “fake news”?

    Paper passages:
    A common criterion to judge if an article is fake is if it is not factually correct, but there are articles that are factually correct but are satirical or controversial.

    Answer:
     - The paper does not specify how “fake news” is defined.
     - This paper uses language features to predict if an article is “fake news” or not (feature: variable).

 '1704.06851-Affect-LM for Emotional Text Generation-0']","['A sentence is represented by five features that each mark presence or absence of an emotion: positive emotion, angry, sad, anxious, and negative emotion.']","['Motivated by these advances in neural language modeling and affective analysis of text, in this paper we propose a model for representation and generation of emotional text, which we call the Affect-LM. Our model is trained on conversational speech corpora, common in language modeling for speech recognition applications BIBREF10 . Figure 1 provides an overview of our Affect-LM and its ability to generate emotionally colored conversational text in a number of affect categories with varying affect strengths. While these parameters can be manually tuned to generate conversational text, the affect category can also be automatically inferred from preceding context words. Specifically for model training, the affect category is derived from features generated using keyword spotting from a dictionary of emotional words, such as the LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) tool BIBREF11 . Our primary research questions in this paper are:', 'Our proposed model learns a generative model of the next word $w_t$ conditioned not only on the previous words $w_1,w_2,...,w_{t-1}$ but also on the affect category $\\mathbf {e_{t-1}}$ which is additional information about emotional content. During model training, the affect category is inferred from the context data itself. Thus we define a suitable feature extractor which can utilize an affective lexicon to infer emotion in the context. For our experiments, we have utilized the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis program for feature extraction through keyword spotting. Introduced by BIBREF11 pennebaker2001linguistic, LIWC is based on a dictionary, where each word is assigned to a predefined LIWC category. The categories are chosen based on their association with social, affective, and cognitive processes. For example, the dictionary word worry is assigned to LIWC category anxiety. In our work, we have utilized all word categories of LIWC corresponding to affective processes: positive emotion, angry, sad, anxious, and negative emotion. Thus the descriptor $\\mathbf {e_{t-1}}$ has five features with each feature denoting presence or absence of a specific emotion, which is obtained by binary thresholding of the features extracted from LIWC. For example, the affective representation of the sentence i will fight in the war is $\\mathbf {e_{t-1}}=$ {“sad"":0, “angry"":1, “anxiety"":0, “negative emotion"":1, “positive emotion"":0}.', 'Affect-LM can be used to generate sentences conditioned on the input affect category, the affect strength $\\beta $ , and the context words. For our experiments, we have chosen the following affect categories - positive emotion, anger, sad, anxiety, and negative emotion (which is a superclass of anger, sad and anxiety).

The Affect-LM model trained on the Fisher corpus was used for sentence generation. Each sentence was evaluated by two human raters that have a minimum approval rating of 98% and are located in the United States. The human raters were instructed that the sentences should be considered to be taken from a conversational rather than a written context: repetitions and pause fillers (e.g., um, uh) are common and no punctuation is provided. The human raters evaluated each sentence on a seven-point Likert scale for the five affect categories, overall affective valence as well as the sentence's grammatical correctness and were paid 0.05USD per sentence.

As for proficiency indicators, one first step that could be taken in order to increase accuracy in the evaluation phase both for human and automatic scoring would be to divide the second indicator (pronunciation and fluency) into two different indicators, since fluent students might not necessarily have good pronunciation skills and vice versa, drawing for example on the IELTS Speaking band descriptors. Also, next campaigns might consider an additional indicator specifically addressed to score prosody (in particular intonation and rhythm), especially for A2 and B1 level test-takers. Considering the scope of the evaluation campaign, it is important to be aware of the limitations of the associated data sets: proficiency levels limited to A1, B1 and B2 (CEFR); custom indicators conceived for expert evaluation (not particularly suitable for automated evaluation); limited amount of responses per speaker. Nevertheless, as already discussed, the fact that the TLT campaign was carried out in 2016 and 2018 in the whole Trentino region makes the corpus a valuable linguistic resource for a number of studies associated to second language acquisition and evaluation.

For future evaluations, more experts are expected to provide independent scoring on same data sets, so this kind of evaluation will be possible.', 'Furthermore, since the sets of data from which “TLT-school” was derived were primarily acquired for measuring proficiency of second language (L2) learners, it is quite obvious to exploit the corpus for automatic speech rating. To this purpose, one can try to develop automatic approaches to reliably estimate the above-mentioned indicators used by the human experts who scored the answers of the pupils (such an approach is described in BIBREF0). However, it has to be noticed that scientific literature proposes to use several features and indicators for automatic speech scoring, partly different from those adopted in “TLT-school” corpus (see below for a brief review of the literature). Hence, we believe that adding new annotations to the corpus, related to particular aspects of language proficiency, can stimulate research and experimentation in this area.', 'All the collected sentences have been annotated by human experts in terms of some predefined “indicators” which, in turn, were used to assign the proficiency level to each student undertaking the assigned test. This level is expressed according to the well-known Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Council of Europe, 2001) scale. The CEFR defines 6 levels of proficiency: A1 (beginner), A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2. The levels considered in the evaluation campaigns where the data have been collected are: A1, A2 and B1.', 'Tables and report some statistics extracted from both the written and spoken data collected so far in all the campaigns.

The procedure used for data acquisition and for their annotation in terms of proficiency indicators has been also reported. Part of the data has been manually transcribed according to some guidelines: this set of data is going to be made publicly available. With regard to data acquisition, some limitations of the corpus have been observed that might be easily overcome during next campaigns. Special attention should be paid to enhancing the elicitation techniques, starting from adjusting the questions presented to test-takers.

Therefore, each block contains only answers to the same question, explicitly reported at the beginning of the block.', 'After a joint training session, we paired students together. Each pair first transcribed, individually, the same block of 5 minutes. Then, they went through a comparison phase, where each pair of students discussed their choices and agreed on a single transcription for the assigned data. Transcriptions made before the comparison phase were retained to evaluate inter-annotator agreement. Apart from this first 5 minute block, each utterance was transcribed by only one transcriber. Inter-annotator agreement for the 5-minute blocks is shown in Table in terms of words (after removing hesitations and other labels related to background voices and noises, etc.).

A list, though not recent, as well as a brief description of most of them can be found in BIBREF6. The same paper also gives information on how the data sets are distributed and can be accessed (many of them are available through both LDC and ELDA agencies). Some of the corpora also provide proficiency ratings to be used in CALL applications. Among them, we mention the ISLE corpus BIBREF7, which also contains transcriptions at the phonetic level and was used in the experiments reported in BIBREF0. Note that all corpora mentioned in BIBREF6 come from adult speech while, to our knowledge, the access to publicly available non-native children's speech corpora, as well as of children's speech corpora in general, is still scarce. Specifically concerning non-native children's speech, we believe worth mentioning the following corpora. The PF-STAR corpus (see BIBREF8) contains English utterances read by both Italian and German children, between 6 and 13 years old. The same corpus also contains utterances read by English children. The ChildIt corpus BIBREF9 contains English utterances (both read and imitated) by Italian children."", 'Next, we concatenated utterances to be transcribed into blocks of about 5 minutes each. We noticed that knowing the question and hearing several answers could be of great help for transcribing some poorly pronounced words or phrases. Therefore, each block contains only answers to the same question, explicitly reported at the beginning of the block.', 'In Trentino, an autonomous region in northern Italy, there is a series of evaluation campaigns underway for testing L2 linguistic competence of Italian students taking proficiency tests in both English and German. A set of three evaluation campaigns is underway, two having been completed in 2016 and 2018, and a final one scheduled in 2020. Note that the “TLT-school” corpus refers to only the 2018 campaign, that was split in two parts: 2017 try-out data set (involving about 500 pupils) and the actual 2018 data (about 2500 pupils). Each of the three campaigns (i.e. 2016, 2018 and 2020) involves about 3000 students ranging from 9 to 16 years, belonging to four different school grade levels and three proficiency levels (A1, A2, B1). The schools involved in the evaluations are located in most part of the Trentino region, not only in its main towns; Table highlights some information about the pupils that took part to the campaigns. Several tests, aimed at assessing the language learning skills of the students, were carried out by means of multiple-choice questions, which can be evaluated automatically. However, a detailed linguistic evaluation cannot be performed without allowing the students to express themselves in both written sentences and spoken utterances, which typically require the intervention of human experts to be scored.', 'In order to address automatic assessment of complex spoken tasks requiring more general communication capabilities from L2 learners, the AZELLA data set BIBREF3, developed by Pearson, has been collected and used as benchmark for some researches BIBREF4, BIBREF3.

Since we believe that a simple model will be faster in training and easier to analyse, we opt to use simple techniques in our proposed model, including 1) an RNN as the encoder, and a predict-all-words CNN as the decoder, 2) learning by inferring subsequent contiguous words, 3) mean+max pooling, and 4) tying word vectors with word prediction. With thorough discussion and extensive evaluation, we justify our decision making for each component in our RNN-CNN model. In terms of the performance and the efficiency of training, we justify that our model is a fast and simple algorithm for learning generic sentence representations from unlabelled corpora. Further research will focus on how to maximise the utility of the context information, and how to design simple architectures to best make use of it.', 'We varied the length of target sequences in three cases, which are 10, 30 and 50, and measured the performance of three models on all tasks. As stated in rows 1, 3, and 4 in Table TABREF21 , decoding short target sequences results in a slightly lower Pearson score on SICK, and decoding longer target sequences lead to a longer training time. In our understanding, decoding longer target sequences leads to a harder optimisation task, and decoding shorter ones leads to a problem that not enough context information is included for every input sentence. A proper length of target sequences is able to balance these two issues.

    We focus on two types of datasets. The first one is the one used for the time series prediction. It consists of human-written, i.e. fully-textual documents. The second dataset we use is a synthetic dataset. It is built on the first one by adding a synthetic historical element to the time series and a synthetic element to the written reports.
    We first build a synthetic dataset that contains a fully-textual document for each day of the year, with a synthetic time series and a synthetic textual representation of the weather at the corresponding time. The synthetic time series is built using the 20 years of real time series we used in the previous section. For each day we use the corresponding time series to generate the synthetic time series.

What geometric properties do embeddings display?,['1910.12618-Experiments ::: Interpretability of the models ::: Vector embedding representation-2'],['Winter and summer words formed two separate clusters. Week day and week-end day words also formed separate clusters.'],"['The initial analyses of the embedding matrices for both the UK and France revealed that in general, words were grouped by context or influence on the electricity consumption. For instance, we observed that winter words were together and far away from summer ones. Week days were grouped as well and far from week-end days. However considering the vocabulary was reduced to $V^* = 52$ words, those results lacked of consistency. Therefore for both languages we decided to re-train the RNNs using the same architecture, but with a larger vocabulary of the $V=300$ most relevant words (still in the RF sense) and on all the available data (i.e. everything is used as training) to compensate for the increased size of the vocabulary. We then calculated the distance of a few prominent words to the others. The analysis of the average cosine distance over $B=10$ runs for three major words is given by tables TABREF38 and TABREF39, and three other examples are given in the appendix tables TABREF57 and TABREF58. The first row corresponds to the reference word vector $\\overrightarrow{w_1}$ used to calculate the distance from (thus the distance is always zero), while the following ones are the 9 closest to it. The two last rows correspond to words we deemed important to check the distance with (an antagonistic one or relevant one not in the top 9 for instance).']","
            The second representation is a neural word embedding. It consists in representing every word in the corpus by a real-valued vector of dimension $q$. Such models are usually obtained by learning a vector representation from word co-occurrences in a very large corpus (typically hundred thousands of documents, such as Wikipedia articles for example). The two most popular embeddings are probably Google's Word2Vec BIBREF19 and Standford's GloVe BIBREF20. In the former, a neural network is trained to predict a word given its context (continuous bag of word model), whereas in the latter a matrix factorization scheme on the log co-occurences of words is applied. In any case, the very nature of the objective function allows the embedding models to learn to translate linguistic similarities into geometric properties in the vector space. For instance the vector $\overrightarrow{king} - \overrightarrow{man} + \overrightarrow{woman}$ is expected to be very close to the vector $\overrightarrow{queen}$. However in our case we want a vector encoding which is tailored for the technical vocabulary of our weather reports and for the subsequent prediction task.

This is why we decided to train our own word embedding from scratch during the learning phase of our recurrent or convolutional neural network. Aside from the much more restricted size of our corpora, the major difference with the aforementioned embeddings is that in our case it is obtained by minimizing a squared loss on the prediction. In that framework there is no explicit reason for our representation to display any geometric structure. However as detailed in section SECREF36, our word vectors nonetheless display geometric properties pertaining to the behavior of the time series."", 'Word vector embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe are known for their vectorial properties translating linguistic ones. However considering the objective function of our problem, there was no obvious reason for such attributes to appear in our own. Nevertheless for both languages we conducted an analysis of the geometric properties of our embedding matrix. We investigated the distances between word vectors, the relevant metric being the cosine distance given by:', 'The texts were encoded numerically using either TF-IDF or our own neural word embedding. A plethora of machine learning algorithms such as random forests or neural networks were applied on top of those representations. Our results were consistent over language, numerical representation of the text and prediction algorithm, proving the intrinsic value of the textual sources for the three considered time series. Contrarily to previous works in the field of textual data for time series forecasting, we went in depth and quantified the impact of words on the variations of the series. As such we saw that all the algorithms naturally extract calendar and meteorological information from the texts, and that words impact the time series in the expected way (e.g. winter words increase the consumption and summer ones decrease it). Despite being trained on a regular quadratic loss, our neural word embedding spontaneously builds geometric properties. Not only does the norm of a word vector reflect its significance, but the words are also grouped by topic with for example winter, summer or day of the week clusters.', 'In order to achieve a global view of the embeddings, the t-SNE algorithm BIBREF30 is applied to project an embedding matrix into a 2 dimensional space, for both languages. The observations for the few aforementioned words are confirmed by this representation, as plotted in figure FIGREF44. Thematic clusters can be observed, roughly corresponding to winter, summer, week-days, week-end days for both languages. Globally summer and winter seem opposed, although one should keep in mind that the t-SNE representation does not preserve the cosine distance. The clusters of the French embedding appear much more compact than the UK one, comforting the observations made when explicitly calculating the cosine distances.', 'The main contribution of our paper is to suggest the use of a certain type of textual documents, namely daily weather report, to build forecasters of the daily national electricity load, average temperature and wind speed for both France and the United-Kingdom (UK).

As expected, all text based methods perform poorer than when using explicitly numerical input features. Indeed, despite containing relevant information, the text is always more fuzzy and less precise than an explicit value for the temperature or the time of the year for instance. Again the aim of this work is not to beat traditional methods with text, but quantifying how close one can come to traditional approaches when using text exclusively. As such achieving less than 5% of MAPE was nonetheless deemed impressive by expert electricity forecasters. Feature selection brings significant improvement in the French case, although it does not yield any improvement in the English one. The reason for this is currently unknown. Nevertheless the feature selection procedure also helps the NNs by dramatically reducing the vocabulary size, and without it the training of the networks was bound to fail. While the errors accross methods are roughly comparable and highlight the valuable information contained within the reports, the best method nonetheless fluctuates between languages. Indeed in the French case there is a hegemony of the NNs, with the embedding RNN edging the MLP TF-IDF one. However for the UK data set the RFs yield significantly better results on the test set than the NNs. This inversion of performance of the algorithms is possibly due to a change in the way the reports were written by the Met Office after August 2017, since the results of the MLP and RNN on the validation set (not shown here) were satisfactory and better than both RFs. For the two languages both the CNN and the LASSO yielded poor results. For the former, it is because despite grid search no satisfactory architecture was found, whereas the latter is a linear approach and was used more for interpretation purposes than strong performance. Finally the naive aggregation of the two best experts always yields improvement, especially for the French case where the two different encodings are combined. This emphasises the specificity of the two representations leading to different types of errors. An example of comparison between ground truth and forecast for the case of electricity consumption is given for the French language with fig. FIGREF29, while another for temperature may be found in the appendix FIGREF51. The sudden ""spikes"" in the forecast are due to the presence of winter related words in a summer report. This is the case when used in comparisons, such as ""The flood will be as severe as in January"" in a June report and is a limit of our approach. Finally, the usual residual $\\hat{\\varepsilon }_t = y_t - \\hat{y}_t$ analyses procedures were applied: Kolmogorov normality test, QQplots comparaison to gaussian quantiles, residual/fit comparison... While not thoroughly gaussian, the residuals were close to normality nonetheless and displayed satisfactory properties such as being generally independent from the fitted and ground truth values. Excerpts of this analysis for France are given in figure FIGREF52 of the appendix. The results for the temperature and wind series are given in appendix. Considering that they have a more stochastic behavior and are thus more difficult to predict, the order of magnitude of the errors differ (the MAPE being around 15% for temperature for instance) but globally the same observations can be made.', 'The main contribution of our paper is to suggest the use of a certain type of textual documents, namely daily weather report, to build forecasters of the daily national electricity load, average temperature and wind speed for both France and the United-Kingdom (UK).

As such, emphasis is put on the predictive results on the load demand time series.', 'In this study, a novel pipeline to predict three types of time series using exclusively a textual source was proposed. Making use of publicly available daily weather reports, we were able to predict the electricity consumption with less than 5% of MAPE for both France and the United-Kingdom. Moreover our average national temperature and wind speed predictions displayed sufficient accuracy to be used to replace missing data or as first approximation in traditional models in case of unavailability of meteorological features.', 'The field of electricity consumption is one where expert knowledge is broad. It is known that the major phenomena driving the load demand are calendar (time of the year, day of the week, ...) and meteorological. For instance generalized additive models (GAM) BIBREF12 representing the consumption as a sum of functions of the time of the year, temperature and wind speed (among others) typically yield less than 1.5% of relative error for French national electricity demand and 8% for local one BIBREF13, BIBREF14. Neural networks and their variants, with their ability to extract patterns from heterogeneous types of data have also obtained state-of-the-art results BIBREF15, BIBREF16, BIBREF17. However to our knowledge no exploratory work using text has been conducted yet. Including such data in electricity demand forecasting models would not only contribute to close the gap with other domains, but also help to understand better which aspects of text are useful, how the encoding of the text influences forecasts and to which extend a prediction algorithm can extract relevant information from unstructured data. Moreover the major drawback of all the aforementioned approaches is that they require meteorological data that may be difficult to find, unavailable in real time or expensive. Textual sources such as weather reports on the other hand are easy to find, usually available on a daily basis and free.', 'The goal of our experiments is to quantify how close one can get using textual data only when compared to numerical data. However the inputs of the numerical benchmark should be hence comparable to the information contained in the weather reports.

This paper contains an empirical comparison of several existing approaches and hence we hope that our paper can act as a guideline to researchers attempting to tackle extremely low-resource translation.', 'When these models were further fine-tuned only on the in-domain Ja INLINEFORM0 Ru parallel data (IV and VI), we obtained translations of better quality than the two baselines for Ja INLINEFORM1 Ru pair. However, as a result of complete ignorance of Ja INLINEFORM2 En and Ru INLINEFORM3 En pairs, the models only produced translations of poor quality for these language pairs. In contrast, mixed fine-tuning for the second fine-tuning stage (V and VII) resulted in consistently better models than conventional fine-tuning (IV and VI), irrespective of the choice at the first stage, thanks to the gradual shift of parameters realized by in-domain Ja INLINEFORM4 En and Ru INLINEFORM5 En parallel data. Unfortunately, the translation quality for Ja INLINEFORM6 En and Ru INLINEFORM7 En pairs sometimes degraded from II and III. Nevertheless, the BLEU scores still retain the large margin against two baselines.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,100.00000000000004,0.01923076923076923,0.1671778776117208,1.0,"3.7 BLEU points compared to a strong baseline

    We began with evaluating standard MT paradigms, i.e., PBSMT BIBREF3 and NMT BIBREF1 . As for PBSMT, we also examined two advanced methods: pivot-based translation relying on a helping language BIBREF10 and induction of phrase tables from monolingual data BIBREF14 .
As for NMT, we compared two types of encoder-decoder architectures: attentional RNN-based model (RNMT) BIBREF2 and the Transformer model BIBREF18 . In addition to standard uni-directional modeling, to cope with the low-resource problem, we examined two multi-directional models: bi-directional model BIBREF11 and multi-to-multi (M2M) model BIBREF8 .
After identifying the best model, we also examined the usefulness of a data augmentation method based on back-translation BIBREF17 .

Any tweets stating any facts, news or reality were classified as non-humorous. There were many tweets which did not contain any hashtags, to understand the context of such tweets annotators selected some keywords from the tweet and searched them online.

When receiving a new input frame, the corresponding posteriors are recovered using previous computations, kept in memory for efficiency purposes as described in Figure 2 . This cached implementation allows to reduce the amount of Floating Point Operations per Second (FLOPS) to a level suiting production requirements.', 'Standard convolutional networks cannot capture long temporal patterns with reasonably small models due to the increase in computational cost yielded by larger receptive fields. Dilated convolutions skip some input values so that the convolution kernel is applied over a larger area than its own. The network therefore operates on a larger scale, without the downside of increasing the number of parameters. The receptive field $r$ of a network made of stacked convolutions indeed reads: $r = \\sum _i d_i (s_i - 1),$ ', 'Fig. 2: Dilated convolution layers with an exponential dilation rate of 1, 2, 4, 8 and filter size of 2.

By end-to-end model, we mean a straight-forward model with a binary target that does not require a precise phoneme alignment beforehand. We explore an architecture based on a stack of dilated convolution layers, effectively operating on a broader scale than with standard convolutions while limiting model size. We further improve our solution with gated activations and residual skip-connections, inspired by the WaveNet style architecture explored previously for text-to-speech applications BIBREF10 and voice activity detection BIBREF9 , but never applied to KWS to our knowledge. In BIBREF11 , the authors explore Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) for KWS. ResNets differ from WaveNet models in that they do not leverage skip-connections and gating, and apply convolution kernels in the frequency domain, drastically increasing the computational cost.', 'The network consists in an initial causal convolution layer (filter size of 3) and 24 layers of gated dilated convolutions (filter size of 3). The 24 dilation rates are a repeating sequence of $\\lbrace 1, 2, 4, 8, 1, 2, 4, 8...\\rbrace $ . Residual connections are created between each layer and skip connections are accumulated at each layer and are eventually fed to a DNN followed by a softmax for classification as depicted in Figure 1 . We used projection layers of size 16 for residual connections and of size 32 for skip connections. The optimal duration of the end-of-keyword labeling interval as defined in Section ""End-of-keyword labeling"" is $\\Delta t = 160ms$ (15 frames before and 15 frames after the end of the keyword). The posteriors are smoothed over a sliding context window of $w_{smooth}=30$ frames, also tuned on the dev set.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1584905660377358,0.2522010694452797,100.00000000000004,0.13157894736842105,3.1778688236459476,1.0,"
    Dilated convolutions are a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) which allow for a wider receptive field than standard convolutions. In other words, dilated convolutions have a larger input window than standard convolutions, which means they can capture information from a larger portion of the input signal.

    In the context of KWS, dilated convolutions are often used in combination with other CNN architectures, such as residual networks or attention-based networks, to improve performance.

    Dilated convolutions have been shown to be effective in a variety of NLP applications, including language modeling, text classification, and named entity recognition.

    In summary, dilated convolutions are a powerful tool for NLP tasks that need to capture information from a large portion of the input signal.

    Question: 

    Paper passages:
    In this paper, we propose a novel method to model the language of instructions and generate the plan for the robot. The framework is inspired by the GRU-based methods proposed in [12] and the seq2seq model proposed in [13]. The input is a sequence of instructions, and the output is a sequence of actions. The seq2seq model is based on a bi-directional LSTM network. The forward LSTM network takes a sequence of words as input and produces a sequence of hidden states. The backward LSTM network takes a sequence of hidden states as input and produces a sequence of words. We set the dimension of LSTM to 400 and the dimension of output words to 20.

The major advantage of using a word embedding is that it allows to perform textual analysis at scale. With a bag of words (BoW) representation of text, the most frequent words are given more importance. However, this approach does not take into account the semantic meaning of words. By learning a vector representation of words, we can ensure that the most important words retain their semantic meaning. Moreover, word embeddings are generalised representations of words that can be used to represent many different languages.
            2. Deep learning technologies are now widely used to do text classification. The main challenge is to fine-tune the hyper-parameters of the model to get the best performance. This is often time consuming. For this, two main approaches can be used:
            a. A grid search can be performed over the parameters of the model to find the best combination. However, this is time consuming and can be computationally expensive.
            b. A Bayesian optimisation approach can be used to explore the space of possible parameters. It is more efficient but can be more costly in terms of computing resources.

Although the degree of harm is recorded by the reporting person for every event, this information can be unreliable as reporters have been known to game the system, or to give different answers depending on their professional status BIBREF6. Previous work on predicting the severity of adverse events BIBREF7, BIBREF8 used reports submitted to the Advanced Incident Management System by Australian public hospitals, and used BoW and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to detect extreme-risk events. Here we demonstrate that publicly reported measures derived from NHS Staff Surveys can help select ground truth labels that allow supervised training of machine learning classifiers to predict the degree of harm directly from text embeddings. Further, we show that the unsupervised clusters of content derived with our method improve the classification results significantly.', 'We have used our clusters within a supervised classifier to predict the degree of harm of an incident based only on free-text descriptions.

We choose to keep only 30 communities as this performs well when combined with the Doc2Vec embedding (without slowing too much the classifier). We performed a grid search to optimise the hyperparameters of our model (penalty = 10, tolerance for stopping criterion = 0.0001, linear kernel). For the O-ranked records, our model achieves a weighted F1 score of 0.657, with a 19% improvement with respect to TF-iDF text features and a 107% improvement with respect to categorical features. (For the PRC records, the corresponding improvements are 33% and 215%, respectively.) Note that similar improvements are also obtained for the other classifiers when using Doc2Vec and MS labels as features. It is also worth noting that the differences in the prediction of DoH between PRC and O-ranked records is reduced when using text tools and, specifically, the F1-score of the SVM classifier based on Doc2Vec with MS is almost the same for both datasets. Hence the difference in the quality of the reporting categories can be ameliorated by the use of the textual content of the reports.

            We have applied a multiscale graph partitioning algorithm (Markov Stability) to extract content-based clusters of documents from a textual dataset of incident reports in an unsupervised manner at different levels of resolution.

To do so, we combine deep neural-network high-dimensional text-embedding algorithms with graph-theoretical methods for multiscale clustering. Specifically, we apply the framework of Markov Stability (MS), a multiscale community detection algorithm, to sparsified graphs of documents obtained from text vector similarities. Our method departs both from traditional natural language processing tools, which have generally used bag-of-words (BoW) representation of documents and statistical methods based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to cluster documents BIBREF2, and from more recent approaches that have used deep neural network based language models, but have used k-means clustering without a graph-based analysis BIBREF3. Previous applications of network theory to text analysis have included the work of Lanchichinetti and co-workers BIBREF4, who proposed a probabilistic graph construction analysed with the InfoMap algorithm BIBREF5; however, their community detection was carried out at a single-scale and the BoW representation of text lacks the power of text embeddings. The application of multiscale community detection allows us to find groups of records with consistent content at different levels of resolution; hence the content categories emerge from the textual data, rather than from pre-designed classifications. The obtained results can help mitigate human error or effort in finding the right category in complex classification trees. We illustrate in our analysis the insight gained from this unsupervised, multi-resolution approach in this specialised corpus of medical records.', 'Our framework combines text-embedding, geometric graph construction and multi-resolution community detection to identify, rather than impose, content-based clusters from free, unstructured text in an unsupervised manner.', 'Fig. 1: Pipeline for data analysis contains training of the text embedding model along with the two methods we showcase in this work.

    Question:
    What does ELMo stand for?

    Paper passages:
    ELMo is a bidirectional LSTM language model.
    It is capable of modeling bidirectional context, where the entire context of a word can be represented with a single vector, regardless of its position in the sentence.

    Answer:
    Embeddings from Language Models

    Question:
    What is ELMo’s advantage over other NLP models?

    Paper passages:
    ELMo is the first language model to successfully model contexts of arbitrary length, as opposed to the 20-25 word contexts used by other models.
    The authors also claim that ELMo generalizes better than other LSTM-based models since it tries to predict the entire context, rather than just a few words on the left and right of a predicted token.

    Answer:
    ELMo is trained to model not only short contexts, but also the entire context of a word. Other models only predict words on the left and right of a predicted token.

We obtained new state-of-the-art results using the Fastext-It embeddings, and improved the F1-class score of 6.5 points in strict evaluation mode. As for the event detection subtask, we observe a limited improvement (+1.3 points in strict F1), mainly due to gains in Recall. Such results are extremely positive as the task has been modeled in a single step approach, i.e. detection and classification at once, for the first time in Italian. Further support that embeddings have a major impact in the performance of neural architectures is provided, as the variations in performance of the Bi-LSMT-CRF models show. This is due to a combination of factors such as dimensionality, (raw) data, and the method used for generating the embeddings.', 'The network obtains the best F1 score, both for detection (F1 of 0.880 for strict evaluation and 0.903 for relaxed evaluation with Fastext-It embeddings) and for classification (F1-class of 0.756 for strict evaluation, and 0.751 for relaxed evaluation with Fastext-It embeddings). Although FBK-HLT suffers in the classification subtask, it qualifies as a highly competitive system for the detection subtask. By observing the strict F1 scores, FBK-HLT beats three configurations (DH-FBK-100, ILC-ItWack, Berardi2015_Glove) , almost equals one (Berardi2015_w2v) , and it is outperformed only by one (Fastext-It) . In the relaxed evaluation setting, DH-FBK-100 is the only configuration that does not beat FBK-HLT (although the difference is only 0.001 point). Nevertheless, it is remarkable to observe that FBK-HLT has a very high Precision (0.902, relaxed evaluation mode), that is overcome by only one embedding configuration, ILC-ItWack. The results also indicates that word embeddings have a major contribution on Recall, supporting observations that distributed representations have better generalization capabilities than discrete feature vectors. This is further supported by the fact that these results are obtained using a single step approach, where the network has to deal with a total of 15 possible different labels.', 'We further compared the outputs of the best model, i.e. Fastext-It, against FBK-HLT. As for the event detection subtask, we have adopted an event-based analysis rather than a token based one, as this will provide better insights on errors concerning multi-token events and event parts-of-speech (see Table 1 for reference). By analyzing the True Positives, we observe that the Fastext-It model has better performances than FBK-HLT with nouns (77.78% vs. 65.64%, respectively) and prepositional phrases (28.00% vs. 16.00%, respectively). Performances are very close for verbs (88.04% vs. 88.49%, respectively) and adjectives (80.50% vs. 79.66%, respectively). These results, especially those for prepositional phrases, indicates that the Bi-LSTM-CRF network structure and embeddings are also much more robust at detecting multi-tokens instances of events, and difficult realizations of events, such as nouns.', 'We approached the task in a single-step by detecting and classifying event mentions at once rather than in the standard two step approach, i.e. detection first and classification on top of the detected elements.

We obtained new state-of-the-art results using the Fastext-It embeddings, and improved the F1-class score of 6.5 points in strict evaluation mode. As for the event detection subtask, we observe a limited improvement (+1.3 points in strict F1), mainly due to gains in Recall. Such results are extremely positive as the task has been modeled in a single step approach, i.e. detection and classification at once, for the first time in Italian. Further support that embeddings have a major impact in the performance of neural architectures is provided, as the variations in performance of the Bi-LSMT-CRF models show. This is due to a combination of factors such as dimensionality, (raw) data, and the method used for generating the embeddings.', 'Since the EVENTI campaign, there has been a lack of further research, especially in the application of deep learning models to this task in Italian. The contributions of this paper are the followings: i.) the adaptation of a state-of-the-art sequence to sequence (seq2seq) neural system to event detection and classification for Italian in a single step approach; ii.) an investigation on the quality of existing Italian word embeddings for this task; iii.) a comparison against a state-of-the-art discrete classifier. The pre-trained models and scripts running the system (or re-train it) are publicly available. .', 'We further compared the outputs of the best model, i.e. Fastext-It, against FBK-HLT. As for the event detection subtask, we have adopted an event-based analysis rather than a token based one, as this will provide better insights on errors concerning multi-token events and event parts-of-speech (see Table 1 for reference). By analyzing the True Positives, we observe that the Fastext-It model has better performances than FBK-HLT with nouns (77.78% vs. 65.64%, respectively) and prepositional phrases (28.00% vs. 16.00%, respectively). Performances are very close for verbs (88.04% vs. 88.49%, respectively) and adjectives (80.50% vs. 79.66%, respectively). These results, especially those for prepositional phrases, indicates that the Bi-LSTM-CRF network structure and embeddings are also much more robust at detecting multi-tokens instances of events, and difficult realizations of events, such as nouns.', ""The results of the Bi-LSTM-CRF network are varied in both evaluation configurations. The differences are mainly due to the embeddings used to initialize the network. The best embedding configuration is Fastext-It that differentiate from all the others for the approach used for generating the embeddings. Embedding's dimensionality impacts on the performances supporting the findings in BIBREF14 , but it seems that the quantity (and variety) of data used to generate the embeddings can have a mitigating effect, as shown by the results of the DH-FBK-100 configuration (especially in the classification subtask, and in the Recall scores for the event extent subtask). Coverage of the embeddings (and consequenlty, tokenization of the dataset and the embeddings) is a further aspect to keep into account, but it seems to have a minor impact with respect to dimensionality. It turns out that BIBREF15 's embeddings are those suffering the most from out of vocabulary (OVV) tokens (2.14% and 1.06% in training, 2.77% and 1.84% in test for the word2vec model and GloVe, respectively) with respect to the others. However, they still outperform DH-FBK_100 and ILC-ItWack, whose OVV are much lower (0.73% in training and 1.12% in test for DH-FBK_100; 0.74% in training and 0.83% in test for ILC-ItWack)."", 'The network obtains the best F1 score, both for detection (F1 of 0.880 for strict evaluation and 0.903 for relaxed evaluation with Fastext-It embeddings) and for classification (F1-class of 0.756 for strict evaluation, and 0.751 for relaxed evaluation with Fastext-It embeddings). Although FBK-HLT suffers in the classification subtask, it qualifies as a highly competitive system for the detection subtask. By observing the strict F1 scores, FBK-HLT beats three configurations (DH-FBK-100, ILC-ItWack, Berardi2015_Glove) , almost equals one (Berardi2015_w2v) , and it is outperformed only by one (Fastext-It) . In the relaxed evaluation setting, DH-FBK-100 is the only configuration that does not beat FBK-HLT (although the difference is only 0.001 point). Nevertheless, it is remarkable to observe that FBK-HLT has a very high Precision (0.902, relaxed evaluation mode), that is overcome by only one embedding configuration, ILC-ItWack. The results also indicates that word embeddings have a major contribution on Recall, supporting observations that distributed representations have better generalization capabilities than discrete feature vectors. This is further supported by the fact that these results are obtained using a single step approach, where the network has to deal with a total of 15 possible different labels.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.3061224489795918,0.6415682118736294,100.00000000000004,0.325,16.777467898166655,1.0,"

Empirical results demonstrate that outline generation for capturing the inherent content structure is feasible and our proposed method can outperform all the baselines significantly. We also provide detailed analysis on the proposed model, and conduct case studies to provide better understanding on the learned content structure.', 'The overall performance comparisons between our HiStGen and the step-wise baselines are shown in Table TABREF61 . We have the following observations: (1) The INLINEFORM0 process (i.e., INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 and INLINEFORM4 ) performs very poorly. By looking at the results of the INLINEFORM5 methods, we find that INLINEFORM6 tends to segment the document into too much sections since it usually generates different headings even for paragraphs that should belong to a same section. (2) For the INLINEFORM7 process, the methods based on INLINEFORM8 perform better than that based on INLINEFORM9 . For example, the relative improvement of INLINEFORM10 over INLINEFORM11 is about INLINEFORM12 in terms of EM INLINEFORM13 on the mixture set. We analyze the results and find that using INLINEFORM14 can obtain better section prediction results, showing that the dependency on the context labels is more important than that on all the paragraphs for section identification. Moreover, for the INLINEFORM15 process, the generative methods can achieve significantly better results than the extractive methods, since those extractive methods are unsupervised in nature. (3) Our INLINEFORM16 model can outperform all the step-wise baselines significantly (p-value INLINEFORM17 0.01). As compared with the best-performing baseline INLINEFORM18 , the relative improvement of INLINEFORM19 over INLINEFORM20 is about INLINEFORM21 in terms of EM INLINEFORM22 on the mixture set. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our end-to-end learning model.', 'Keyword extraction aims to automatically extract some keywords from a document. Most of the existing keyword extraction methods have addressed this problem through two steps. The first step is to acquire a list of keyword candidates (e.g., n-grams or chunks) with heuristic methods BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 . The second step is to rank candidates on their importance to the document, either with supervised machine learning methods BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 or unsupervised machine learning methods BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , BIBREF0 . However, these approaches could neither identify keywords that do not appear in the text, nor capture the real semantic meaning behind the text. Recently, natural language generation models are used to automatically generate keywords. BIBREF21 BIBREF21 applied an encoder-decoder framework BIBREF22 with a copy mechanism BIBREF23 to this task, achieving state-of-the-art performance. BIBREF11 BIBREF11 modeled correlation among multiple keywords in an end-to-end fashion to eliminate duplicate keywords and improve result coherence.', 'To better understand how different models perform, we conduct some case studies. We take one Wikipedia article from the “celebrity” test data as an example. As shown in Figure FIGREF62 , there are 15 paragraphs in this article, which are segmented into 7 sections. We show the identified sections and generated headings from our model as well as that from the baseline model INLINEFORM0 . We can find that: (1) The number of sections predicted by INLINEFORM1 is larger than the ground-truth (i.e., INLINEFORM2 ) and the segmentation is totally wrong. The results show that using current paragraph representation and context label dependency, CRF may not be able to make correct section boundary prediction. (2) Without considering the coherence between context headings, INLINEFORM3 generates repetitive headings (e.g., “career” repeats twice) and the heading with inconsistent style (e.g., “citizen political” is not suitable for the description of a celebrity). (3) Our INLINEFORM4 can generate right section boundaries and consistent headings. Note that INLINEFORM5 generates “family” for the third section whose true heading is “personal life”. As we look at that section, we found that “family” is actually a very proper heading and INLINEFORM6 did not generate the “personal life” as the heading possibly due to the review mechanism by avoiding partial duplication with the “early life” heading.', 'We conduct ablation analysis to investigate the effect of proposed mechanisms in our HiStGen model. As shown in table TABREF55 , we can observe that: (1) By removing the Markov paragraph dependence mechanism, the performance of INLINEFORM0 in terms of EM INLINEFORM1 has a significant drop as compared with INLINEFORM2 .

                Methods for Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation (NART). Neural machine translation (NMT) is a powerful and effective machine translation model that has recently achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, it is not efficient enough for online use. NMT is based on the idea of autoregressive language modeling, which is not parallelizable. This means that the model must generate tokens sequentially as $y_{<t}$ must be inferred on the fly. Such autoregressive behavior becomes the bottleneck of the computational time. In this paper, we proposed to use hints from a well-trained ART model to enhance the training of NART models. We used the output of the ART teacher model to guide our NART model to predict the next token. We showed that this approach significantly outperforms previous NART baselines, with one order of magnitude faster in inference than ART models.

Compared to previous datasets, Fakeddit provides a large quantity of text+image samples with multiple labels for various levels of fine-grained classification. We created detection models that incorporate both modalities of data and conducted experiments, showing that there is still room for improvement in fake news detection. Although we do not utilize submission metadata and comments made by users on the submissions, we anticipate that these features will be useful for further research. We hope that our dataset can be used to advance efforts to combat the ever growing rampant spread of misinformation.', 'The results are shown in Tables TABREF17 and SECREF3. We found that the multimodal features performed the best, followed by text-only, and image-only in all instances. Thus, having both image and text improves fake news detection. For image and multimodal classification, ResNet50 performed the best followed by VGG16 and EfficientNet. In addition, BERT generally achieved better results than InferSent for multimodal classification. However, for text-only classification InferSent outperformed BERT. The “maximum” method to merge image and text features yielded the highest accuracy, followed by average, concatenate, and add. Overall, the multimodal model that combined BERT text features and ResNet50 image features through the maximum method performed most optimally.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.4956521739130434,0.8515983045188503,100.00000000000004,0.20183486238532108,3.7074550480560764,1.0,"

    Question: What is the novelty of this paper?

    Paper passages:
    In this paper, we propose KANE, a novel knowledge graph embedding framework, which combines the rich structural information of KGs and the semantics of triples. Specifically, we construct a knowledge network to encode the structural information of KGs, and a knowledge attention network to model the semantics of triples. As a result, the proposed KANE model can capture high-order structural information and rich semantic information encoded in attribute triples. We conduct extensive experiments on the three datasets, and the experimental results show that KANE outperforms all the baseline models.

    Answer:

    The novelty of this paper is two-fold: First, it can capture structural information of Knowledge Graphs, which is important for further improving the performance of Knowledge Graph Embedding. Secondly, it can capture rich semantic information encoded in attribute triples, which is also important for further improving the performance of Knowledge Graph Embedding.

            Text-to-image synthesis aims to synthesize images based on text inputs. Different from image-to-image translation, text-to-image synthesis has an extra challenge of incorporating semantic information. To tackle this problem, several deep learning based methods have been proposed. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art methods.

            We first introduce the motivations and challenges of text-to-image synthesis. We then review state-of-the-art methods for text-to-image synthesis and discuss their limitations. Finally, we conclude our paper and discuss future directions.

Then, we give a survey of the state-of-the-art methods for text-to-image synthesis in Section 3. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 4.

            In Proceedings of the 1st Conference on Learning for Text Generation

            Question: what is the sentence selection algorithm?
            Answer:
            We calculate the sentence-level TF-IDF vector for each sentence in the document using the term-document matrix and the inverse of the sentence-length vector (the inverse of the term-length matrix). We then calculate the similarity between each sentence and each other sentence in the corpus.

            Question: how many passages are there in the corpus?
            Answer:
            We use the MRPC dataset which contains 250,000 sentences from 10,","['1708.07690-Original Centroid-based Method-1', '1708.07690-Introduction-1', '1708.07690-Introduction-5', '1708.07690-Example Summaries-0', '1708.07690-Modified Summary Selection-2']","['A summary is selected by de-queuing the ranked list of sentences in decreasing order until the desired summary length is reached.', 'Many approaches are based on sentence ranking, i.e. assigning each sentence a score that indicates how well the sentence summarizes the input BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . A summary is created by selecting the top entries of the ranked list of sentences. Since the sentences are often treated separately, these models might allow redundancy in the summary. Therefore, they are often extended by an anti-redundancy filter while de-queuing ranked sentence lists.', 'In order to keep the method efficient, we outline different methods to select a small number of candidate sentences from each document in the input collection before constructing the summary.', 'Table TABREF10 shows generated example summaries using the global centroid method with the three sentence preselection methods. For readability, truncated sentences (due to the 100-word limit) at the end of the summaries are excluded. The original positions of the summary sentences, i.e. the indices of the document and the sentence inside the document are given. As can be seen in the examples, the N-first method is restricted to sentences appearing early in documents. In the new-TF-IDF example, the second and third sentences were preselected because high ranking features such as ""robot"" and ""arm"" appeared for the first time in the respective documents.', 'In the experiments, we will therefore call this modification the ""global"" variant of the centroid model. The same principle is used by the KLSum model BIBREF3 in which the optimal summary minimizes the KL-divergence of the probability distribution of words in the input from the distribution in the summary. KLSum uses a greedy algorithm to find the best summary. Starting with an empty summary, the algorithm includes at each iteration the sentence that maximizes the similarity to the centroid when added to the already selected sentences. We also use this algorithm for sentence selection. The procedure is depicted in Algorithm SECREF5 below.

A summary is selected by de-queuing the ranked list of sentences in decreasing order until the desired summary length is reached.

    2. We implement the selection of top-ranking features for both the original and modified models slightly differently to BIBREF7 : all words in the vocabulary are ranked by their value in the centroid vector.

One straightforward approach for this task is to translate English captions into Vietnamese by human or by using machine translation tool, Google translation. With the method of translating directly from English to Vietnamese, we found that the descriptions are sometimes confusing and unnatural to native people. Moreover, image understandings are cultural dependent, as in Western, people usually have different ways to grasp images and different vocabulary choices for describing contexts. For instance, in Fig. FIGREF2, one MS-COCO English caption introduce about ""a baseball player in motion of pitching"", which makes sense and capture accurately the main activity in the image.

From this function, the library uses auto-differentiation and the identities from the previous section, to define a complete distribution object. The core models implemented by the library are shown in Table TABREF2.', ""Table TABREF2 shows all of the structures and distributions implemented in Torch-Struct.

Macaw is implemented in Python, thus machine learning models implemented using PyTorch, Scikit-learn, or TensorFlow can be easily integrated into Macaw. The high-level overview of Macaw is depicted in FIGREF8. The user interacts with the interface and the interface produces a Message object from the current interaction of user. The interaction can be in multi-modal form, such as text, speech, image, and click. Macaw stores all interactions in an “Interaction Database”. For every interaction, Macaw looks for most recent user-system interactions (including the system's responses) to create a list of Messages, called the conversation list. It is then dispatched to multiple information seeking (and related) actions. The actions run in parallel, and each should respond within a pre-defined time interval. The output selection component selects from (or potentially combines) the outputs generated by different actions and creates a Message object as the system's response.

Each interaction in Macaw (from both user and system) is a Message object, thus a conversation is a list of Messages. Macaw consists of multiple actions, each action is a module that can satisfy the information needs of users for some requests. For example, search and question answering can be two actions in Macaw. Even multiple search algorithms can be also seen as multiple actions. Each action can produce multiple outputs (e.g., multiple retrieved documents). For every user interaction, Macaw runs all actions in parallel. The actions' outputs produced within a predefined time interval (i.e., an interaction timeout constant) are then post-processed.

Therefore, some common metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy are used to measure system performance, compared to the gold label. This evaluation is similar to emotion classification tasks such as previous SemEval 2018 BIBREF32 and SemEval 2019 . Other studies also proposed to use perplexity to evaluate the model at the content level (to determine whether the content is relevant and grammatical) BIBREF14 , BIBREF39 , BIBREF28 . This evaluation metric is widely used to evaluate dialogue-based systems which rely on probabilistic approach BIBREF61 . Another work by BIBREF14 used BLEU to evaluate the machine response and compare against the gold response (the actual response), although using BLEU to measure conversation generation task is not recommended by BIBREF62 due to its low correlation with human judgment.', ""This evaluation involves human judgement to measure the chatbots' performance, based on several criteria. BIBREF15 used three annotators to rate chatbots' response in two criteria, content (scale 0,1,2) and emotion (scale 0,1). Content is focused on measuring whether the response is natural acceptable and could plausible produced by a human. This metric measurement is already adopted and recommended by researchers and conversation challenging tasks, as proposed in BIBREF38 . Meanwhile, emotion is defined as whether the emotion expression contained in the response agrees with the given gold emotion category. Similarly, BIBREF28 used four annotators to score the response based on consistency, logic and emotion. Consistency measures the fluency and grammatical aspect of the response. Logic measures the degree whether the post and response logically match. Emotion measures the response, whether it contains the appropriate emotion. All of these aspects were measured by three scales 0, 1, and 2. Meanwhile, BIBREF39 proposed naturalness and emotion impact as criteria to evaluate the chatbots' response. Naturalness evaluates whether the response is intelligible, logically follows the context of the conversation, and acceptable as a human response, while emotion impact measures whether the response elicits a positive emotional or triggers an emotionally-positive dialogue, since their study focus only on positive emotion. Another study by BIBREF14 uses crowdsourcing to gather human judgement based on three aspects of performance including empathy/sympathy - did the responses show understanding of the feelings of the person talking about their experience?; relevance - did the responses seem appropriate to the conversation? Were they on-topic?; and fluency - could you understand the responses? Did the language seem accurate?. All of these aspects recorded with three different response, i.e., (1: not at all, 3: somewhat, 5: very much) from around 100 different annotators. After getting all of the human judgement with different criteria, some of these studies used a t-test to get the statistical significance BIBREF28 , BIBREF39 , while some other used inter-annotator agreement measurement such as Fleiss Kappa BIBREF15 , BIBREF14 . Based on these evaluations, they can compare their system performance with baseline or any other state of the art systems.""]","

We focus on three main issues, including, how to incorporate affective information into chatbots, what are resources that available and can be used to build EAC, and how to evaluate EAC performance. The rise of EAC was started by Parry, which uses a simple rule-based approach. Now, most of EAC are built by using a neural-based approach, by exploiting emotion classifier to detect emotion contained in the text. In the modern era, the development of EAC gains more attention since Emotion Generation Challenge shared task on NLPCC 2017. In this era, most EAC is developed by adopting encoder-decoder architecture with sequence-to-sequence learning. Some variant of the recurrent neural network is used in the learning process, including long-short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). There are also some datasets available for developing EAC now. However, the datasets are only available in English and Chinese. These datasets are gathered from various sources, including social media, online website and manual construction by crowdsourcing. Overall, the difference between these datasets and the common datasets for building chatbot is the presence of an emotion label. In addition, we also investigate the available affective resources which usually use in the emotion classification task. In this part, we only focus on English resources and found several resources from the old one such as LIWC and Emolex to the new one, including DepecheMood and EmoWordNet. In the final part, we gather information about how to evaluate the performance of EAC, and we can classify the approach into two techniques, including qualitative and quantitative assessment. For qualitative assessment, most studies used ISO 9241, which covers several aspects such as efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. While in quantitative analysis, two techniques can be used, including automatic evaluation (by using perplexity) and manual evaluation (involving human judgement). Overall, we can see that effort to humanize chatbots by incorporation affective aspect is becoming the hot topic now. We also predict that this development will continue by going into multilingual perspective since up to now every chatbot only focusing on one language. Also, we think that in the future the studies of humanizing chatbot are not only utilized emotion information but will also focus on a contextual-aware chatbot.', ""We characterize the evaluation of Emotionally-Aware Chatbot into two different parts, qualitative and quantitative assessment. Qualitative assessment will focus on assessing the functionality of the software, while quantitative more focus on measure the chatbots' performance with a number."", ""Satisfaction aspect has three categories, including affect, ethics and behaviour, and accessibility. Affect is the most suitable assessment categories for EAC. This category asses several quality aspects such as, chatbots' ability to convey personality, give conversational cues, provide emotional information through tone, inflexion, and expressivity, entertain and/or enable the participant to enjoy the interaction and also read and respond to moods of human participant BIBREF59 . Ethic and behaviour category focuses on how a chatbot can protect and respect privacy BIBREF57 . Other quality aspects, including sensitivity to safety and social concerns and trustworthiness BIBREF60 . The last categories are accessibility, which the main quality aspect focus to assess the chatbot ability to detect meaning or intent and, also responds to social cues ."", 'Another vital part of building EAC is emotion classifier to detect emotion contained in the text to produce a more meaningful response. Emotion detection is a well-established task in natural language processing research area. This task was promoted in two latest series of SemEval-2018 (Task 1) and SemEval-2019 (Task 3). Some tasks were focusing on classifying utterance into several categories of emotion BIBREF32 . However, there is also a task which trying to predict the emotion intensities contained in the text BIBREF33 . In the early development of emotion classifier, most of the studies proposed to use traditional machine-learning approach. However, the neural-based approach is able to gain better performance, which leads more scholars to exploit it to deal with this task. In chatbot, the system will generate several responses based on several emotion categories. Then the system will respond with the most appropriate emotion based on emotion detected on posted utterance by emotion classifier. Based on Table TABREF10 , studies have different emotion categories based on their focus and objective in building chatbots.', 'As we mentioned before that emotion is an essential aspect of building humanize chatbot. The rise of the emotionally-aware chatbot is started by Parry BIBREF22 in early 1975. Now, most of EAC development exploits neural-based model. In this section, we will try to review previous works which focus on EAC development. Table TABREF10 summarizes this information includes the objective and exploited approach of each work. In early development, EAC is designed by using a rule-based approach. However, in recent years mostly EAC exploit neural-based approach. Studies in EAC development become a hot topic start from 2017, noted by the first shared task in Emotion Generation Challenge on NLPCC 2017 BIBREF31 .

    EAC is evaluated using the same technique like most of the NLP paper use, which involve human judgement and automatic evaluation. Most of this evaluation involves human judgement to measure the chatbots' performance, based on several criteria. The criteria used to evaluate EAC is qualitative and quantitative.
    Qualitative assessment mainly focus on assessing the system functionality, which includes efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction.
    Efficiency mainly focus on how the system can manage a conversation with a limited time and resource. Effectiveness mainly focus on the system performance to achieve the specified goals. Satisfaction focus on the user experience during the interaction with the system.
    Quantitative assessment focus on measure the chatbots' performance with a number, such as precision, recall, and accuracy.

    In automatic evaluation, some studies focus on evaluating the system at emotion level. Therefore, some common metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy are used to measure system performance, compared to the gold label.

In a nutshell, each audio sample $\\mathbf {x}_{\\text{sam}}^{z}$ gets annotated by $N_{\\text{cp}}$ different annotators in the first step of the framework. The annotators have access only to $\\mathbf {x}_{\\text{sam}}^{z}$ and not any other information. In the second step, different annotators are instructed to correct any grammatical errors, typos, and/or rephrase the captions. This process results in $2\\times N_{\\text{cp}}$ captions per $\\mathbf {x}_{\\text{sam}}^{z}$. Finally, three (again different) annotators have access to $\\mathbf {x}_{\\text{sam}}^{z}$ and its $2\\times N_{\\text{cp}}$ captions, and score each caption in terms of the accuracy of the description and fluency of English, using a scale from 1 to 4 (the higher the better). The captions for each $\\mathbf {x}_{\\text{sam}}^{z}$ are sorted (first according to accuracy of description and then according to fluency), and two groups are formed: the top $N_{\\text{cp}}$ and the bottom $N_{\\text{cp}}$ captions. The top $N_{\\text{cp}}$ captions are selected as $\\mathbb {C}_{\\text{sam}}^{z}$. We manually sanitize further $\\mathbb {C}_{\\text{sam}}^{z}$, e.g. by replacing “it's” with “it is” or “its”, making consistent hyphenation and compound words (e.g. “nonstop”, “non-stop”, and “non stop”), removing words or rephrasing captions pertaining to the content of speech (e.g. “French”, “foreign”), and removing/replacing named entities (e.g. “Windex”)."", 'Recently, two different datasets for audio captioning were presented, Audio Caption and AudioCaps BIBREF5, BIBREF6. Audio Caption is partially released, and contains 3710 domain-specific (hospital) video clips with their audio tracks, and annotations that were originally obtained in Mandarin Chinese and afterwards translated to English using machine translation BIBREF5. The annotators had access and viewed the videos. The annotations contain description of the speech content (e.g. “The patient inquired about the location of the doctor’s police station”). AudioCaps dataset has 46 000 audio samples from AudioSet BIBREF7, annotated with one caption each using the crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and automated quality and location control of the annotators BIBREF6. Authors of AudioCaps did not use categories of sounds which they claimed that visuals were required for correct recognition, e.g. “inside small room”. Annotators of AudioCaps were provided the word labels (by AudioSet) and viewed the accompanying videos of the audio samples.', 'In this paper we present the freely available audio captioning dataset Clotho, with 4981 audio samples and 24 905 captions. All audio samples are from Freesound platform BIBREF8, and are of duration from 15 to 30 seconds. Each audio sample has five captions of eight to 20 words length, collected by AMT and a specific protocol for crowdsourcing audio annotations, which ensures diversity and reduced grammatical errors BIBREF0. During annotation no other information but the audio signal was available to the annotators, e.g. video or word tags. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section SECREF2 presents the creation of Clotho, i.e. gathering and processing of the audio samples and captions, and the splitting of the data to development, evaluation, and testing splits. Section SECREF3 presents the baseline method used, the process followed for its evaluation using Clotho, and the obtained results. Section SECREF4 concludes the paper.', 'The perceptual ambiguity of sounds can be hampered by providing contextual information (e.g. word labels) to annotators, making them aware of the actual source and not letting them describe their own perceived information. Using visual stimuli (e.g. video) introduces a bias, since annotators may describe what they see and not what they hear. Also, a single caption per file impedes the learning and evaluation of diverse descriptions of information, and domain-specific data of previous audio captioning datasets have an observed significant impact on the performance of methods BIBREF5. Finally, unique words (i.e. words appearing only once) affect the learning process, as they have an impact on the evaluation process (e.g. if a word is unique, will be either on training or on evaluation). An audio captioning dataset should at least provide some information on unique words contained in its captions.', 'Finally, we observe that some captions include transcription of speech. To remove it, we employ extra annotators (not from AMT) which had access only at the captions. We instruct the annotators to remove the transcribed speech and rephrase the caption. If the result is less than eight words, we check the bottom $N_{\\text{cp}}$ captions for that audio sample. If they include a caption that has been rated with at least 3 by all the annotators for both accuracy and fluency, and does not contain transcribed speech, we use that caption. Otherwise, we remove completely the audio sample.

The first data batch (16,360 tweets) consists of tweets relevant to blizzards, hurricanes, and wildfires, under the constraint that they are tweeted by “influential"" tweeters, who we define as individuals certain to have a classifiable sentiment regarding the topic at hand. For example, we assume that any tweet composed by Al Gore regarding climate change is a positive sample, whereas any tweet from conspiracy account @ClimateHiJinx is a negative sample.
            3. The assumption we make in ensuing methods (confirmed as reasonable in Section SECREF2 ) is that influential tweeters can be used to label tweets in bulk in the absence of manually-labeled tweets. Here, we enforce binary labels for all tweets composed by each of the 133 influential tweeters that we identified on Twitter (87 of whom accept climate change), yielding a total of 16,360 influential tweets.

We now discuss our final method on outcomes: comparing average Twitter sentiment pre-event to post-event. In Figure FIGREF8 , we display these metrics in two ways: first, as an overall average of tweet binary sentiment, and second, as a within-cohort average of tweet sentiment for the subset of tweets by users who tweeted both before and after the event (hence minimizing awareness bias). We use Student\'s t-test to calculate the significance of mean sentiment differences pre- and post-event (see Section SECREF4 ). Note that we perform these mean comparisons on all event-related data, since the low number of geo-tagged samples would produce an underpowered study.', 'The RNN pre-trained using GloVe word embeddings BIBREF6 achieved the higest test accuracy. We pass tokenized features into the embedding layer, followed by an LSTM BIBREF7 with dropout and ReLU activation, and a dense layer with sigmoid activation. We apply an Adam optimizer on the binary crossentropy loss. Implementing this simple, one-layer LSTM allows us to surpass the other traditional machine learning classification methods. Note the 13-point spread between validation and test accuracies achieved. Ideally, the training, validation, and test datasets have the same underlying distribution of tweet sentiments; the assumption made with our labeling technique is that the influential accounts chosen are representative of all Twitter accounts. Critically, when choosing the influential Twitter users who believe in climate change, we highlighted primarily politicians or news sources (i.e., verifiably affirming or denying climate change); these tweets rarely make spelling errors or use sarcasm. Due to this skew, the model yields a high rate of false negatives. It is likely that we could lessen the gap between validation and test accuracies by finding more “real"" Twitter users who are climate change believers, e.g. by using the methodology found in BIBREF4 .', 'First, we show that machine learning models formed using our labeling technique can accurately predict tweet sentiment (see Section SECREF2 ). We introduce a novel method to intuit binary sentiments of large numbers of tweets for training purposes. Second, we quantify unbiased outcomes from these predicted sentiments (see Section SECREF4 ). We do this by comparing sentiments within the same cohort of Twitter users tweeting both before and after specific natural disasters; this removes bias from over-weighting Twitter users who are only compelled to compose tweets after a disaster.', 'The first data batch consists of tweets relevant to blizzards, hurricanes, and wildfires, under the constraint that they are tweeted by “influential"" tweeters, who we define as individuals certain to have a classifiable sentiment regarding the topic at hand.

The training set contains 49.2% positive samples, and the validation set contains 49.0% positive samples. We form our test set by manually labeling a subset of 500 tweets from the the event-related tweets (randomly chosen across all five natural disasters), of which 50.0% are positive samples.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.9077490774907748,13.902851556898248,100.00000000000004,0.3708609271523179,16.97186455172599,1.0,"1. Over-sampling: The first attempt to use limited labelled data is to over-sample the training data. While it can help improve model performance on a given dataset, we can not recommend this method as an approach to generalise to new data.

    2. Transfer learning: The second approach is to pre-train a model on the limited labelled data and then fine tune the model on a larger unlabelled data. We can refer to this as transfer learning.

    3. Classifier combination: The third approach is to combine multiple classifiers to deal with the problem of limited labelled data.

In particular, the applicability of the Caravel approach remains highly questionable, as it requires a corpus where the information regarding Y/N-distribution is known beforehand in order to set the threshold. In regard to the two examined unary AV approaches MOCC and OCCAV, we observed that these perform poorly on all three corpora in comparison to the binary-intrinsic and binary-extrinsic methods. Most likely, this is caused by the wrong threshold setting, as both tend to generate more N-predictions. From the remaining approaches, GLAD and COAV seem to be a good choice for realistic scenarios. However, the former has been shown to be more robust in regard to varying text lengths given a fixed model, while the latter requires a retraining of the model (note that both performed almost equal in terms of AUC). Our hypothesis, which we leave open for future work, is that AV methods relying on a complex model INLINEFORM0 are more robust than methods based on a scalar-threshold INLINEFORM1 . Lastly, we wish to underline that all examined approaches failed in the cross-topic experiment. One possibility to counteract this is to apply text distortion techniques (for instance, BIBREF41 ) in order to control the topic influence in the documents.', 'The results of the 12 examined AV methods are listed in Table TABREF41 , where it can be seen that the majority of the examined AV methods yield useful recognition results with a maximum value of 0.792 in terms of c@1. With the exception of the binary-intrinsic approach COAV, the remaining top performing methods belong to the binary-extrinsic category. This category of AV methods has also been superior in the PAN-AV competitions BIBREF11 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF12 , where they outperformed binary-intrinsic and unary approaches three times in a row (2013–2015).', 'In the following we show to which extent these assumptions hold. As a data basis for this experiment, we used the INLINEFORM0 corpus introduced in Section UID30 . The results regarding the 12 AV methods are given in Table TABREF44 , where it can be seen that our assumptions hold. All examined AV methods (with no exception) are fooled by the topical bias in the corpus. Here, the highest achieved results in terms of c@1 and AUC are very close to random guessing. A closer look at the confusion matrix outcomes reveals that some methods, for example ImpGI and OCCAV, perform almost entirely inverse to each other, where the former predicts nothing but Y and the latter nothing but N (except 1 Y). Moreover, we can assume that the lower c@1 is, the stronger is the focus of the respective AV method on the topic of the documents. Overall, the results of this experiment suggest that none of the examined AV methods is robust against topical influence.', 'As a basis for our experiments, we reimplemented 12 existing AV approaches, which have shown their potentials in the previous PAN-AV competitions BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 as well as in a number of AV studies.

The improvement over the method of BIBREF20 however, does not necessarily mean that classify and count performs better in the task. It implies that the feature set we used is richer, that in turn highlights the value of robust feature extraction mechanisms which is the subject of this paper.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1463414634146341,0.2693764552297112,100.00000000000004,0.1639344262295082,1.3576630145622517,1.0,"

The weights $\\alpha _{t}$ are produced by an attention mechanism presented in BIBREF9 (see Fig. FIGREF7), which is an MLP with l layers. This attention mechanism differs from most previous ones BIBREF16, BIBREF17, because it is used in a classification setting, where there is no previously generated output sub-sequence to drive the attention. It assigns larger weights $\\alpha _{t}$ to hidden states $h_{t}$ corresponding to positions, where there is more evidence that the tweet should be harassment (or any other specific type of harassment) or not. In our work we are using four attention mechanisms instead of one that is presented in BIBREF9. Particularly, we are using one attention mechanism per category. Another element that differentiates our approach from Pavlopoulos et al. BIBREF9 is that we are using a projection layer for the word embeddings (see Fig. FIGREF2). In the next subsection we describe the Model Architecture of our approach.', 'We compare eight different models in our experiments. Four of them have a Projected Layer (see Fig. FIGREF2), while the others do not have, and this is the only difference between these two groups of our models. So, we actually include four models in our experiments (having a projected layer or not). Firstly, LastStateRNN is the classic RNN model, where the last state passes through an MLP and then the LR Layer estimates the corresponding probability. In contrast, in the AvgRNN model we consider the average vector of all states that come out of the cells. The AttentionRNN model is the one that it has been presented in BIBREF9. Moreover, we introduce the MultiAttentionRNN model for the harassment language detection, which instead of one attention, it includes four attentions, one for each category.']","
            This is very interesting work, as it is about natural language processing (NLP). I have never worked with NLP, so I cannot comment on the accuracy of the paper. However, I think that the content of the paper is interesting and it is well written. I have also read some of the other papers submitted by the authors and I think that the authors are making good progress. I think that the authors should continue their work and try to publish their papers in more prestigious journals.
            I am not sure if I am right, but I think that the authors are not giving an answer to the question. The paper is about the detection of harassment language in tweets. The authors are not saying anything about what they are doing to detect harassment language. The only thing that is mentioned is that they are using the Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). I do not think that this is a good answer to the question.
            The authors are not giving any concrete examples of how they are using the Deep RNNs to detect harassment language.

Finally, we describe the experiments and we present the results and our conclusion.', 'For the detection of hate speech in social media like twitter, many approaches have been proposed. Jha and Mamidi BIBREF0 tested support vector machine, bi-directional RNN encoder-decoder and FastText on hostile and benevolent sexist tweets. They also used SentiWordNet and subjectivity lexicon on the extracted phrases to show the polarity of the tweets. Sharifirad et al. BIBREF4 trained, tested and evaluated different classification methods on the SemEval2018 dataset and chose the classifier with the highest accuracy for testing on each category of sexist tweets to know the mental state and the affectual state of the user who tweets in each category. To overcome the limitations of small data sets on sexist speech detection, Sharifirad S. et al. BIBREF5 have applied text augmentation and text generation with certain success. They have generated new tweets by replacing words in order to increase the size of our training set. Moreover, in the presented text augmentation approach, the number of tweets in each class remains the same, but their words are augmented with words extracted from their ConceptNet relations and their description extracted from Wikidata. Zhang et al. BIBREF6 combined convolutional and gated recurrent networks to detect hate speech in tweets. Others have proposed different methods, which are not based on deep learning. Burnap and Williams BIBREF7 used Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and a meta-classifier to distinguish between hateful and non-hateful messages. A survey of recent research in the field is presented in BIBREF8. For the problem of the hate speech detection a few approaches have been proposed that are based on the Attention mechanism. Pavlopoulos et al. BIBREF9 have proposed a novel, classification-specific attention mechanism that improves the performance of the RNN further for the detection of abusive content in the web. Xie et al. BIBREF10 for emotion intensity prediction, which is a similar problem to ours, have proposed a novel attention mechanism for CNN model that associates attention-based weights for every convolution window. Park and Fung BIBREF11 transformed the classiﬁcation into a 2-step problem, where abusive text ﬁrst is distinguished from the non-abusive, and then the class of abuse (Sexism or Racism) is determined. However, while the first part of the two step classiﬁcation performs quite well, it falls short in detecting the particular class the abusive text belongs to. Pitsilis et al. BIBREF12 have proposed a detection scheme that is an ensemble of RNN classiﬁers, which incorporates various features associated with user related information, such as the users’ tendency towards racism or sexism', 'We are presenting an attention-based approach for the problem of the harassment detection in tweets. In this section, we describe the basic approach of our work. We are using RNN models because of their ability to deal with sequence information. The RNN model is a chain of GRU cells BIBREF15 that transforms the tokens $w_{1}, w_{2},..., w_{k}$ of each tweet to the hidden states $h_{1}, h_{2},..., h_{k}$, followed by an LR Layer that uses $h_{k}$ to classify the tweet as harassment or non-harassment (similarly for the other categories). Given the vocabulary V and a matrix E $\\in $ $R^{d \\times \\vert V \\vert }$ containing d-dimensional word embeddings, an initial $h_{0}$ and a tweet $w = <w_{1},.., w_{k}>$, the RNN computes $h_{1}, h_{2},..., h_{k}$, with $h_{t} \\in R^{m}$, as follows:', 'We compare eight different models in our experiments. Four of them have a Projected Layer (see Fig. FIGREF2), while the others do not have, and this is the only difference between these two groups of our models. So, we actually include four models in our experiments (having a projected layer or not). Firstly, LastStateRNN is the classic RNN model, where the last state passes through an MLP and then the LR Layer estimates the corresponding probability. In contrast, in the AvgRNN model we consider the average vector of all states that come out of the cells. The AttentionRNN model is the one that it has been presented in BIBREF9. Moreover, we introduce the MultiAttentionRNN model for the harassment language detection, which instead of one attention, it includes four attentions, one for each category.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.2599118942731277,0.2411100331661704,100.00000000000004,0.09219858156028368,1.0530490462464008,1.0,"
    The different variations of the attention-based approach which are examined, are:
    
    - LastStateRNN (classic RNN model, where the last state passes through an MLP and then the LR Layer estimates the corresponding probability)
    
    - AvgRNN (where we consider the average vector of all states that come out of the cells)
    
    - AttentionRNN (where the attention mechanism is presented in BIBREF9)
    
    - MultiAttentionRNN (where instead of one attention, it includes four attentions, one for each category)

After the Embedding Layer, we are applying a Spatial Dropout Layer, which drops a certain percentage of dimensions from each word vector in the training sample. The role of Dropout is to improve generalization performance by preventing activations from becoming strongly correlated BIBREF18. Spatial Dropout, which has been proposed in BIBREF19, is an alternative way to use dropout with convolutional neural networks as it is able to dropout entire feature maps from the convolutional layer which are then not used during pooling. After that, the word embeddings are passing through a one-layer MLP, which has tanh as activation function and 128 hidden units, in order to project them in the vector space of our problem considering that they have been pre-trained using text that has a different subject. In the next step the embeddings are fed in a unidirectional GRU having 1 Stacked Layer and size 128. We prefer GRU than LSTM, because it is more efficient computationally. Also the basic advantage of LSTM which is the ability to keep in memory large text documents, does not hold here, because tweets supposed to be not too large text documents. The output states of the GRU are passing through four self-attentions like the one described above BIBREF9, because we are using one attention per category (see Fig. FIGREF7). Finally, a one-layer MLP having 128 nodes and ReLU as activation function computes the final score for each category. At this final stage we have avoided using a softmax function to decide the harassment type considering that the tweet is a harassment, otherwise we had to train our models taking into account only the harassment tweets and this might have been a problem as the dataset is not large enough.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.6695842450765864,1.1314191249397736,100.00000000000004,0.041237113402061855,0.6851753066962897,1.0,"1.

            A. Machine translation is the task of automatically translating text from one natural language to another. It is one of the most challenging tasks in NLP. Machine translation is typically a two-step process: first, a source language model is used to generate a sequence of candidate target words. Then, a target language model is used to translate these words into a target language.
            B. Text classification is a machine learning task that involves assigning tags","['1809.04686-Corpora-1', '1809.04686-Corpora-0', '1809.04686-Corpora-2', '1809.04686-Transfer Learning Results-1', '1809.04686-Model and Training Details-3']","['For the MT task, we use the WMT 2014 En $\\leftrightarrow $ Fr parallel corpus.

We use these two datasets (72 million sentence pairs) to train a single multilingual NMT model to learn both these translation directions simultaneously. We generated a shared sub-word vocabulary BIBREF37 , BIBREF38 of 32K units from all source and target training data. We use this sub-word vocabulary for all of our experiments below.', 'We evaluate the proposed method on three common NLP tasks: Amazon Reviews, SST and SNLI. We utilize parallel data to train our multilingual NMT system, as detailed below.', 'The Amazon reviews dataset BIBREF39 is a multilingual sentiment classification dataset, providing data for four languages - English (En), French (Fr), German (De), and Japanese. We use the English and French datasets in our experiments. The dataset contains 6,000 documents in the train and test portions for each language. Each review consists of a category label, a title, a review, and a star rating (5-point scale). We only use the review text in our experiments. Following BIBREF39 , we mapped the reviews with lower scores (1 and 2) to negative examples and the reviews with higher scores (4 and 5) to positive examples, thereby turning it into a binary classification problem. Reviews with score 3 are dropped. We split the training dataset into 10% for development and the rest for training, and we truncate each example and keep the first 200 words in the review. Note that, since the data for each language was obtained by crawling different product pages, the data is not aligned across languages.', 'Table 1 summarizes the accuracy of our proposed system for these three different approaches and the state-of-the-art results on all the tasks. The first row in the table shows the baseline accuracy of our system for all four datasets. The second row shows the result from initializing with a pre-trained multilingual NMT encoder. It can be seen that this provides a significant improvement in accuracy, an average of 4.63%, across all the tasks. This illustrates that the multilingual NMT encoder has successfully learned transferable contextualized representations that are leveraged by the classifier component of our proposed system. These results are in line with the results in BIBREF5 where the authors used the representations from the top NMT encoder layer as an additional input to the task-specific system. However, in our setup we reused all of the layers of the encoder as a single pre-trained component in the task-specific system. The third row shows the results from freezing the pre-trained encoder after initialization and only training the classifier component. For the Amazon English and French tasks, freezing the encoder after initialization significantly improves the performance further. We hypothesize that since the Amazon dataset is a document level classification task, the long input sequences are very different from the short sequences consumed by the NMT system and hence freezing the encoder seems to have a positive effect. This hypothesis is also supported by the SNLI and SST results, which contain sentence-level input sequences, where we did not find any significant difference between freezing and not freezing the encoder.', 'Similar to BIBREF30 , multilingual NMT model is trained in a multi-task learning setup, where each decoder is augmented with a task-specific loss, minimizing the negative conditional log-likelihood of the target sequence given the source sequence.

The idea was to improve the accuracy performance by improving the representation ability of the model with the implementation of novel denoising transformers. More specifically, our model was able to reconstruct hidden embeddings from their respective incomplete hidden embeddings. Stacked DeBERT was compared against three NLU service platforms and two other machine learning methods, namely BERT and Semantic Hashing with neural classifier.

In the Chatbot dataset, accuracy improvement was achieved even without trade-off, with the highest achieving classes maintaining their accuracy while the lower achieving class saw improvement. Further evaluation on the F1-scores decay in the presence of noise demonstrated that our model is more robust than the baseline models when considering noisy data, be that in the form of incorrect sentences or sentences with STT error. Not only that, experiments on the Twitter dataset also showed improved accuracy in clean data, with complete sentences. We infer that this is due to our model being able to extract richer data representations from the input data regardless of the completeness of the sentence. For future works, we plan on evaluating the robustness of our model against other types of noise, such as word reordering, word insertion, and spelling mistakes in sentences. In order to improve the performance of our model, further experiments will be done in search for more appropriate hyperparameters and more complex neural classifiers to substitute the last feedforward network layer.', 'We propose Stacked Denoising BERT (DeBERT) as a novel encoding scheming for the task of incomplete intent classification and sentiment classification from incorrect sentences, such as tweets and text with STT error. The proposed model, illustrated in Fig. FIGREF4, is structured as a stacking of embedding layers and vanilla transformer layers, similarly to the conventional BERT BIBREF10, followed by layers of novel denoising transformers.

Since the first and last corpus gave similar performances with our model, we conclude that the Twitter dataset does not require complete sentences to be given as training input, in addition to the original naturally incorrect tweets, in order to better model the noisy sentences."", 'In this work, we proposed a novel deep neural network, robust to noisy text in the form of sentences with missing and/or incorrect words, called Stacked DeBERT. The idea was to improve the accuracy performance by improving the representation ability of the model with the implementation of novel denoising transformers. More specifically, our model was able to reconstruct hidden embeddings from their respective incomplete hidden embeddings. Stacked DeBERT was compared against three NLU service platforms and two other machine learning methods, namely BERT and Semantic Hashing with neural classifier. Our model showed better performance when evaluated on F1 scores in both Twitter sentiment and intent text with STT error classification tasks. The per-class F1 score was also evaluated in the form of normalized confusion matrices, showing that our model was able to improve the overall performance by better balancing the accuracy of each class, trading-off small decreases in high achieving class for significant improvements in lower performing ones. In the Chatbot dataset, accuracy improvement was achieved even without trade-off, with the highest achieving classes maintaining their accuracy while the lower achieving class saw improvement. Further evaluation on the F1-scores decay in the presence of noise demonstrated that our model is more robust than the baseline models when considering noisy data, be that in the form of incorrect sentences or sentences with STT error. Not only that, experiments on the Twitter dataset also showed improved accuracy in clean data, with complete sentences. We infer that this is due to our model being able to extract richer data representations from the input data regardless of the completeness of the sentence. For future works, we plan on evaluating the robustness of our model against other types of noise, such as word reordering, word insertion, and spelling mistakes in sentences. In order to improve the performance of our model, further experiments will be done in search for more appropriate hyperparameters and more complex neural classifiers to substitute the last feedforward network layer.', ""The incomplete data problem is usually approached as a reconstruction or imputation task and is most often related to missing numbers imputation BIBREF13. Vincent et al. BIBREF14, BIBREF15 propose to reconstruct clean data from its noisy version by mapping the input to meaningful representations. This approach has also been shown to outperform other models, such as predictive mean matching, random forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multiple imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), at missing data imputation tasks BIBREF16, BIBREF17. Researchers in those two areas have shown that meaningful feature representation of data is of utter importance for high performance achieving methods. We propose a model that combines the power of BERT in the NLP domain and the strength of denoising strategies in incomplete data reconstruction to tackle the tasks of incomplete intent and sentiment classification. This enables the implementation of a novel encoding scheme, more robust to incomplete data, called Stacked Denoising BERT or Stacked DeBERT. Our approach consists of obtaining richer input representations from input tokens by stacking denoising transformers on an embedding layer with vanilla transformers. The embedding layer and vanilla transformers extract intermediate input features from the input tokens, and the denoising transformers are responsible for obtaining richer input representations from them. By improving BERT with stronger denoising abilities, we are able to reconstruct missing and incorrect words' embeddings and improve classification accuracy. To summarize, our contribution is two-fold:"", ""The table also indicates the level of noise in each dataset with the already mentioned iBLEU score, where 0 means no noise and higher values mean higher quantity of noise. As expected, the models' accuracy degrade with the increase in noise, thus F1-scores of gtts-witai are higher than macsay-witai. However, while the other models decay rapidly in the presence of noise, our model does not only outperform them but does so with a wider margin. This is shown with the increasing robustness curve in Fig. FIGREF41 and can be demonstrated by macsay-witai outperforming the baseline models by twice the gap achieved by gtts-witai.""]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.2427440633245383,2.304898570780343,100.00000000000004,0.11552346570397112,0.715490519565693,1.0,"

Consequently, of late, a new line of research has focused on creating representations of users in a social network by leveraging the information derived from the connections that they have with other users. In this case, node representations (where nodes represent the authors in the social network) are typically induced using neural architectures. Given the graph representing the social network, such methods create low-dimensional representations for each node, which are optimized to predict the nodes close to it in the network. This approach has the advantage of overcoming the absence of information that the previous approaches face. Among those that implement this idea are Yang et al. yang2016toward, who used representations derived from a social graph to achieve better performance in entity linking tasks, and Chen and Ku chen2016utcnn, who used them for stance classification.', 'We conduct a qualitative analysis of system errors and the cases where author profiling leads to the correct classification of previously misclassified examples. Table 3 shows examples of hateful tweets from the dataset that are misclassified by the lr method, but are correctly classified upon the addition of author profiling features, i.e., by the lr + auth method.

The addition of author profiling features may then be viewed as a proxy for wider discourse information, thus allowing us to correctly resolve the cases where lexical and semantic features alone are insufficient.', ""Several approaches to hate speech detection demonstrate the effectiveness of character-level bag-of-words features in a supervised classification setting BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 . More recent approaches, and currently the best performing ones, utilize recurrent neural networks (rnns) to transform content into dense low-dimensional semantic representations that are then used for classification BIBREF1 , BIBREF7 . All of these approaches rely solely on lexical and semantic features of the text they are applied to. Waseem and Hovy c53cecce142c48628b3883d13155261c adopted a more user-centric approach based on the idea that perpetrators of hate speech are usually segregated into small demographic groups; they went on to show that gender information of authors (i.e., users who have posted content) is a helpful indicator. However, Waseem and Hovy focused only on coarse demographic features of the users, disregarding information about their communication with others. But previous research suggests that users who subscribe to particular stereotypes that promote hate speech tend to form communities online. For example, Zook zook mapped the locations of racist tweets in response to President Obama's re-election to show that such tweets were not uniformly distributed across the United States but formed clusters instead. In this paper, we present the first approach to hate speech detection that leverages author profiling information based on properties of the authors' social network and investigate its effectiveness."", 'Word-sum (ws). As a third baseline, we adopt the “lstm+glove+gbdt"" method of Badjatiya et al. Badjatiya:17, which achieves state-of-the-art results on the Twitter dataset we are using. The authors first utilize an lstm to task-tune glove-initialized word embeddings by propagating the error back from an lr layer. They then train a gradient boosted decision tree (gbdt) classifier to classify texts based on the average of the embeddings of constituent words. We make two minor modifications to this method: we use a 2-layer gru instead of the lstm to tune the embeddings, and we train the gbdt classifier on the l $_2$ -normalized sum of the embeddings instead of their average. Although the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on Twitter by initializing embeddings randomly rather than with glove (which is what we do here), we found the opposite when performing a 10-fold stratified cross-validation (cv). A possible explanation of this lies in the authors\' decision to not use stratification, which for such a highly imbalanced dataset can lead to unexpected outcomes BIBREF18 . Furthermore, the authors train their lstm on the entire dataset (including the test set) without any early stopping criterion, which leads to over-fitting of the randomly-initialized embeddings.', 'However, a number of hateful tweets still remain misclassified despite the addition of author profiling features. According to our analysis, many of these tend to contain urls to hateful content, e.g., “@salmonfarmer1: Logic in the world of Islam http://t.co/6nALv2HPc3"" and “@juliarforster Yes. http://t.co/ixbt0uc7HN"". Since Twitter shortens all urls into a standard format, there is no indication of what they refer to. One way to deal with this limitation could be to additionally maintain a blacklist of links. Another source of system errors is the deliberate obfuscation of words by authors in order to evade detection, e.g., “Kat, a massive c*nt. The biggest ever on #mkr #cuntandandre"". Current hate speech detection methods, including ours, do not directly attempt to address this issue. While this is a challenge for bag-of-word based methods such as lr, we hypothesize that neural networks operating at the character level may be helpful in recognizing obfuscated words.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.3932203389830508,0.0,100.00000000000004,0.047244094488188976,0.9108051273233818,1.0,"1.

This contrast can be explained by the fact that tweets in the racism class come from only 5 unique authors who: (i) are isolated in the community graph, or (ii) have also authored several tweets in the sexism class, or (iii) are densely connected to authors from the sexism and none classes which possibly camouflages their racist nature.', 'In this paper, we answer these questions and develop novel methods that take into account community-based profiling features of authors when examining their tweets for hate speech.

The ESIM science model without training has uniformly poor performance across all categories, whereas the performance of RoBERTa is more varied. Across all datasets and number of hops (i.e., the rows in the heat maps), model performance for RoBERTa is consistently highest among examples with random distractors (i.e., the first column), and lowest in cases involving distractors that are closest in WordNet space (e.g., sister and ISA, or up/down, distractors of distance $k^{\\prime }=1$).

As ironies in the latter two categories are obscure and hard to understand, we decide to only focus on ironies in the first category in this work.

Therefore, we just implement a simple one-layer RNN with LSTM cell to classify pre-processed sentences into ironic sentences and non-ironic sentences because LSTM networks are widely used in irony detection. We train the model with the dataset of Semeval-2018 Task 3. After classification, we get 262,755 ironic sentences and 399,775 non-ironic sentences. According to our observation, not all non-ironic sentences are suitable to be transferred into ironic sentences.

So we remove all interrogative sentences from the non-ironic sentences and only obtain the sentences which have words expressing strong sentiments. We evaluate the sentiment polarity of each word with TextBlob and we view those words with sentiment scores greater than 0.5 or less than -0.5 as words expressing strong sentiments.

This technique relies on two assumptions: a strong domination of one of the senses and that sense being listed first in plWordNet. While the former is almost always true, if the second assumption is false then the created model are adversely affected. In the case of two target words the senses, the first sense in each case (stopień as a musical concept and forma as a synonym of polynomial) was so peculiar that they were unknown to the author of this study and couldn't be assigned to any of the coarse-grained NCP senses. Clearly, not only the method of unsupervised WSD using relatives, but also other solutions related to polysemy would definitely benefit from a reliable ordering of senses in wordnets, especially as increasingly uncommon senses are added to them with time. It is however not clear how such knowledge could be obtained without solving the WSD task first. What is more, sense distributions obviously change with genre, time, author, etc."", 'The senses used for annotation are coarse-grained – with one sense covering a range of related usages. Each word has between two and four senses. To employ the method described in previous section, the NCP senses have been manually mapped to fine-grained plWordNet synsets. As NCP senses have been created independently from wordnet senses, a substantial part of the latter remain uncovered by the former. However, we only found four cases where an NCP sense has no counterpart in wordnet; those words are excluded from the test set.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.2352941176470588,0.2392339934002549,100.00000000000004,0.042168674698795185,0.2541306318680837,1.0,"
    Monosemous relatives have been employed multiple times (see Section 2), but results remain unsatisfactory. The aim of my study is to explore the limitations of this technique by implementing and evaluating such a tool for Polish. Firstly, the method is expanded by waiving the requirement of monosemy and proposing several new sources of relatives. These previously unexplored sources are based on wordnet data and help gather many training cases from the corpus. Secondly, a well-known problem of uneven yet unknown distribution of word senses is alleviated by modifying a naïve Bayesian classifier. Thanks to this correction, the classifier is no longer biased towards senses that have more training data. Finally, a very large corpus (600 million documents), gathered from the web by a Polish search engine NEKST, is used to build models based on training corpora of different sizes. Those experiments show what amount of data is sufficient for such a task. The proposed solution is compared to baselines that use wordnet structure only, with no training corpora.

    The algorithm works as follows. First, a set of relatives is obtained for each sense of a target word using the Polish word",0.4379377599189139,0.7032520325203252

        training a computer to read a passage of text and answer a question about it.

        We introduce a framework, the Answer-Seeking Task (AST), that makes it easier to
        design and evaluate algorithms that perform machine reading comprehension. In
        AST, a machine reading system is scored by how well it answers a given question
        about a passage.

        We find that the AST framework is effective for evaluating existing machine
        reading algorithms and that it reveals important differences between them. We
        then produce new algorithms and show that they can significantly improve

Crowd-sourcing is an efficient way to annotate large quantities of data, but less suitable for healthcare scenarios, where domain knowledge is required to guarantee data quality. To demonstrate the feasibility of a dialogue comprehension system used for extracting key clinical information from symptom monitoring conversations, we developed a framework to construct a simulated human-human dialogue dataset to bootstrap such a prototype. Similar efforts have been conducted for human-machine dialogues for restaurant or movie reservations BIBREF5 . To the best of our knowledge, no one to date has done so for human-human conversations in healthcare.', ""We formulated a dialogue comprehension task motivated by the need in telehealth settings to extract key clinical information from spoken conversations between nurses and patients. We analyzed linguistic characteristics of real-world human-human symptom checking dialogues, constructed a simulated dataset based on linguistically inspired and clinically validated templates, and prototyped a QA system. The model works effectively on a simulated test set using symptoms excluded during training and on real-world conversations between nurses and patients. We are currently improving the model's dialogue comprehension capability in complex reasoning and context understanding and also applying the QA model to summarization and virtual nurse applications."", 'While language understanding tasks in dialogue such as domain identification BIBREF15 , slot filling BIBREF16 and user intent detection BIBREF17 have attracted much research interest, work in dialogue comprehension is still limited, if any.

Some propose to collect text data from human-machine or machine-machine dialogues BIBREF18 , BIBREF5 . In such cases, as human speakers are aware of current limitations of dialogue systems or due to pre-defined assumptions of user simulators, there are fewer cases of zero anaphora, thinking aloud, and topic drift, which occur more often in human-human spoken interactions.', '(d) Multi-Turn Dialogue State Tracking: A greedy algorithm is applied to complete conversations. A “completed symptoms” list and a “to-do symptoms” list are used for symptom topic tracking. We also track the “completed attributes"" and “to-do attributes"". For each symptom, all related attributes are iterated. A dialogue ends only when all possible entities are exhausted, generating a multi-turn dialogue sample, which encourages the model to learn from the entire discussion flow rather than a single turn to comprehend contextual dependency. The average length of a simulated dialogue is 184 words, which happens to be twice as long as an average dialogue from the real-world evaluation set. Moreover, to model the roles of the respondents, we set the ratio between patients and caregivers to 2:1; this statistic is inspired by the real scenarios in the seed dataset. For both the caregivers and patients, we assume equal probability of both genders. The corresponding pronouns in the conversations are thus determined by the role and gender of these settings.', 'Machine comprehension of written passages has made tremendous progress recently. Large quantities of supervised training data for reading comprehension (e.g. SQuAD BIBREF0 ), the wide adoption and intense experimentation of neural modeling BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , and the advancements in vector representations of word embeddings BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 all contribute significantly to the achievements obtained so far. The first factor, the availability of large scale datasets, empowers the latter two factors. To date, there is still very limited well-annotated large-scale data suitable for modeling human-human spoken dialogues.

This dataset was collected by employing a mixture of self-disclosures and information extraction. The authors employed a set of 286 depression-related keywords, and then identified users with at least one of these words in their tweets. However, since this dataset does not contain the metadata of each user such as profile descriptions, followers_count, created_at, and profile_image_url, we remove this dataset.

            For the above mentioned datasets, we use balanced dataset where we maintain 50% of users from each class.

            Paper passages:
            However, we have not made the process of reading comprehension, more accessible to the reader. We assume that the following observations will contribute to a more accessible readability of this paper.
            1. In the area of natural language processing, there are many different tasks. Most commonly, these are word-level or sentence-level tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part of speech tagging. Another popular type of task is document classification, where the goal is to classify the type of the document. When reading comprehension is classified as a task, it is usually done with respect to a goal, such as finding the answer to a question or summarizing a text. While the goal of the task is defined, the way the task is achieved is not. However, in this paper, we intend to understand how the task of reading comprehension can be accomplished.
            This paper discusses the task of reading comprehension as the task of understanding a passage of text and answering a question, where the question is provided to the reader.

While increasing effort is put into the evaluation of novel architectures, such as keeping the evaluation data from public access to prevent unintentional overfitting to test data, performing ablation and error studies and introducing novel metrics BIBREF9, surprisingly little is done to establish the quality of the data itself. Additionally, recent research arrived at worrisome findings: the data of those gold standards, which is usually gathered involving a crowd-sourcing step, suffers from flaws in design BIBREF10 or contains overly specific keywords BIBREF11. Furthermore, these gold standards contain “annotation artefacts”, cues that lead models into focusing on superficial aspects of text, such as lexical overlap and word order, instead of actual language understanding BIBREF12, BIBREF13.

The Bi-LSTM model with 64 attention heads cannot beat the best Trasnformer model with NH=4 and also its results are very close to the Transformer model with NH=1. This observation clearly depicts the power of self-attentional based models and demonstrates that the attention mechanism used in self-attentional models as the backbone for learning, outperforms recurrence-based models even if they are augmented with multiple attention heads.', 'To investigate this question, we ran a number of experiments in which we added multiple attention heads on top of Bi-LSTM model and also tried a different number of self-attention heads in self-attentional models in order to compare their performance for this specific task. Table TABREF25 shows the results of these experiments. Note that the models in Table TABREF25 are actually the best models that we found in our experiments on DSTC2 dataset and we only changed one parameter for each of them, i.e. the number of attention heads in the recurrence-based models and the number of self-attention heads in the self-attentional models, keeping all other parameters unchanged. We also report the results of models with beam size of 2 in inference time. We increased the number of attention heads in the Bi-LSTM model up to 64 heads to see its performance change. Note that increasing the number of attention heads makes the training time intractable and time consuming while the model size would increase significantly as shown in Table TABREF24. Furthermore, by observing the results of the Bi-LSTM+Att model in Table TABREF25 (both test and development set) we can see that Bi-LSTM performance decreases and thus there is no need to increase the attention heads further.', 'As discussed before, Transformer is the first model that entirely relies on the self-attention mechanism for both the encoder and the decoder. The Transformer uses the self-attention mechanism to learn a representation of a sentence by relating different positions of that sentence. Like many of the sequence modelling methods, Transformer follows the encoder-decoder architecture in which the input is given to the encoder and the results of the encoder is passed to the decoder to create the output sequence. The difference between Transformer (which is a self-attentional model) and other sequence models (such as recurrence-based and convolution-based) is that the encoder and decoder architecture is only based on the self-attention mechanism. The Transformer also uses multi-head attention which intends to give the model the ability to look at different representations of the different positions of both the input (encoder self-attention), output (decoder self-attention) and also between input and output (encoder-decoder attention) BIBREF6. It has been used in a variety of NLP tasks such as mathematical language understanding [110], language modeling BIBREF23, machine translation BIBREF6, question answering BIBREF24, and text summarization BIBREF25.', 'Self-attentional models are a new paradigm for sequence modelling tasks which differ from common sequence modelling methods, such as recurrence-based and convolution-based sequence learning, in the way that their architecture is only based on the attention mechanism. The Transformer BIBREF6 and Universal Transformer BIBREF7 models are the first models that entirely rely on the self-attention mechanism for both encoder and decoder, and that is why they are also referred to as a self-attentional models. The Transformer models has produced state-of-the-art results in the task neural machine translation BIBREF6 and this encouraged us to further investigate this model for the task of training task-oriented chatbots. While in the Transformer model there is no recurrence, it turns out that the recurrence used in RNN models is essential for some tasks in NLP including language understanding tasks and thus the Transformer fails to generalize in those tasks BIBREF7. We also investigate the usage of the Universal Transformer for this task to see how it compares to the Transformer model.', 'As discussed before in Section SECREF8, self-attentional models rely on the self-attention mechanism for sequence modelling. Recurrence-based models such as LSTM and Bi-LSTM can also be augmented in order to increase their performance, as evident in Table TABREF14 which shows the increase in the performance of both LSTM and Bi-LSTM when augmented with an attention mechanism. This leads to the question whether we can increase the performance of recurrence-based models by adding multiple attention heads, similar to the multi-head self-attention mechanism used in self-attentional models, and outperform the self-attentional models.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.7757915716335906,100.00000000000004,0.0,0.0,1.0,"3

    The main differences between Wikidata and static knowledge bases extracted from Wikipedia are:
    1. Wikidata is a database that contains facts and metadata about entities.
    2. Static knowledge bases extracted from Wikipedia contain facts and metadata about entities, but they are not as comprehensive as Wikidata.
    3. Entity linking is the task of matching entities in text to entities in the database.

    We can use OpenTapioca, a simple entity linker, to illustrate the differences between Wikidata and static knowledge bases extracted from Wikipedia. OpenTapioca can be trained easily from a Wikidata dump only, and can be efficiently kept up to date in real time as Wikidata evolves.

    We also propose tools to adapt existing entity linking datasets to Wikidata, and offer a new entity linking dataset, consisting of affiliation strings extracted from research articles.

We consider another version that replaces one single word independently at each step without using paired common words, namely the unpaired version. Firstly, for matched adversarial examples that can be semantically different from original sentences, the unpaired version is inapplicable, because the matched label can be easily broken if common words from two sentences are changed into other words independently. And for the unmatched case, we show that the unpaired version is much less effective. For a more fair comparison, we double the step number limit for the unpaired version. As shown in Table TABREF41, the performance of target models on unmatched examples generated by the unpaired version, particularly that of BERT, is mostly much higher than those by our full algorithm, except for BiMPM on MRPC but its accuracies have almost reached 0 (0.0% for unpaired and 0.2% for paired). This demonstrates that our algorithm using paired common words are more effective in generating adversarial examples, on which the performance of the target model is generally much lower. An advantage of using difficult common words for unmatched examples is that such words tend to make target models over-confident about common words and distract the models on recognizing the semantic difference in the unmodified part. Our algorithm explicitly utilizes this property and thus can well reveal such a robustness issue. Moreover, although there is no such a property for the matched case, replacing existing common words with more difficult ones can still distract the target model on judging the semantic similarity in the unmodified part, due to the bias between different words learned by the model, and thus our algorithm for generating adversarial examples with difficult common words works for both matched and unmatched cases.', 'We train each target model on the original training data, and then generate adversarial examples for the target models.

For instance, BIBREF8 trained a series of bigram language models to quantify the violation of social norms in users' posts on an online community by leveraging cross-entropy value, or the deviation of word sequences predicted by the language model and their usage by the user. However, their models were trained on written-language instead of natural face-face dialog corpus. Another kind of social norm violation was examined by BIBREF10 , who developed a classifier to identify specific types of sarcasm in tweets. They utilized a bootstrapping algorithm to automatically extract lists of positive sentiment phrases and negative situation phrases from given sarcastic tweets, which were in turn leveraged to recognize sarcasm in an SVM classifier. However, no contextual information was considered in this work. BIBREF11 understood the nature of social norm violation in dialog by correlating it with associated observable verbal, vocal and visual cues. By leveraging their findings and statistical machine learning techniques, they built a computational model for automatic recognition. While they preserved short-term temporal contextual information in the model, this study avoided dealing with sparsity of the social norm violation phenomena by under-sampling the negative-class instances to make a balanced dataset.""]","

Therefore, we designed Local/Global-Context models to test these hypotheses.', 'We observed that Global-Context RNN with 2 LSTM layers outperformed other models as showed in Table 2. First, by comparing logistic regression model with our best model, the result indicates the strong predictive power of long-term temporal contextual information on the task of detecting social norm violation in dialog. On the other hand, Local-Context RNN model did not achieve significant improvement on overall performance regarding to logistic regression, which means that our learned clause representation through training process has less competence compared to hand-crafted features inspired from linguistic knowledge. One potential reason for such a result could be insufficient amount of training set in order to learn a generic clause representation.', 'In this work, we began by indicating our interest in quantitatively learning the contribution of long-term temporal contextual information on detecting social norm violation in discourse. We then leveraged the power of recurrent neural network on modeling long-term temporal dependency. Inspired by hand-crafted multimodal features derived from qualitative and quantitative analysis in former empirical studies, we developed a Global-Context RNN model to detect social norm violation in human dialog. This model will play a prime role in building socially-aware agents that have capabilities of understanding interpersonal dynamics that unfold in the interaction, which is in turn, essential to better adapt to the interpersonal relationship felt by their users. Thus, to serve this goal, our future work will build a generative model of social norm violation, which will make an agent act towards more realistic human behavior understanding, reasoning and generation. We begin to model those aspects of human-human interaction that are not only helpful to human-agent collaboration, but also sustain aspects of what we cherish most in being human. ', 'Next our Global-Context RNN investigated the influence of clause-level context in detecting social norm violation, by using the LSTM cells to model the long-term temporal dependencies. For a fair comparison, we used the same hand-crafted feature $f_i$ used in the logistic regression model as the representation of clause $c_i$ . As shown in Figure 1 , we first obtained a linear embedding of size 150 $emb_i=W_{e}f_i+b_i$ of $f_i$ . Then $emb_i$ was used as the inputs to LSTM of size 600. The hidden output $h_i$ at each time step was fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 1 hidden layer of size 100. We applied 50% dropout regularization BIBREF13 at the input/output of LSTM and MLP hidden layer for better generalization. Finally the model was optimized w.r.t to the cross entropy loss. A further challenge was the length of dialog. The average number of clauses in training dialog was 817.8, which made it computationally intractable to backpropagate through the entire sequence. Therefore, truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) BIBREF14 was used by unrolling the network for 20 steps. The final state of LSTM of each batch was fetched into the next batch as the initial state.', 'Motivated by theoretical rationale and prior empirical findings concerning the relationship between violation social norm and interpersonal dynamics, in the current work, we take a step towards addressing the above limitations and our contributions are two-fold: (1)We quantitatively evaluate the contribution of long-term temporal contextual information on detecting violation of social norm.

On all text data sets, the hybrid algorithm performs a bit better than the standalone LSTM with the same LSTM state dimension.

The hybrid algorithm with 20 HMM states does better than the one with 10 HMM states. The joint hybrid algorithm outperforms the sequential hybrid on Shakespeare data, but does worse on PTB and Linux data, which suggests that the joint hybrid is more helpful for smaller data sets.

We therefore decided to research and build a machine-learning algorithm that can distinguish between hate speech and non-hate speech.

SWT may be used for translating KBs.'],"['Based on the surveyed works on our research BIBREF6 , SWT have mostly been applied at the semantic analysis step, rather than at the other stages of the translation process, due to their ability to deal with concepts behind the words and provide knowledge about them. As SWT have developed, they have increasingly been able to resolve some of the open challenges of MT. They may be applied in different ways according to each MT approach.', 'SW has already shown its capability for semantic disambiguation of polysemous and homonymous words. However, SWT were applied in two ways to support the semantic disambiguation in MT. First, the ambiguous words were recognized in the source text before carrying out the translation, applying a pre-editing technique. Second, SWT were applied to the output translation in the target language as a post-editing technique. Although applying one of these techniques has increased the quality of a translation, both techniques are tedious to implement when they have to translate common words instead of named entities, then be applied several times to achieve a successful translation.', 'Named Entities. Most NERD approaches link recognized entities with database entries or websites. This method helps to categorize and summarize text, but also contributes to the disambiguation of words in texts. The primary issue in MT systems is caused by common words from a source language that are used as proper nouns in a target language. For instance, the word “Kiwi"" is a family name in New Zealand which comes from the Māori culture, but it also can be a fruit, a bird, or a computer program. Named Entities are a common and difficult problem in both MT (see Koehn BIBREF0 ) and SW fields. The SW achieved important advances in NERD using structured data and semantic annotations, e.g., by adding an rdf:type statement which identifies whether a certain kiwi is a fruit BIBREF14 . In MT systems, however, this problem is directly related to the ambiguity problem and therefore has to be resolved in that wider context.', ""Non-standard speech. The non-standard language problem is a rather important one in the MT field. Many people use the colloquial form to speak and write to each other on social networks. Thus, when MT systems are applied on this context, the input text frequently contains slang, MWE, and unreasonable abbreviations such as “Idr = I don't remember.” and “cya = see you”. Additionally, idioms contribute to this problem, decreasing the translation quality. Idioms often have an entirely different meaning than their separated word meanings. Consequently, most translation outputs of such expressions contain errors. For a good translation, the MT system needs to recognize such slang and try to map it to the target language. Some SMT systems like Google or Bing have recognition patterns over non-standard speech from old translations through the Web using SMT approaches. In rare cases SMT can solve this problem, but considering that new idiomatic expressions appear every day and most of them are isolated sentences, this challenge still remains open. Moreover, each person has their own speaking form."", 'Therefore, we suggest that user characteristics can be applied as context for solving the non-standard language problem. These characteristics can be extracted from social media or user logs and stored as user properties using SWT, e.g., FOAF vocabulary. These ontologies have properties which would help identify the birth place or the interests of a given user. For instance, the properties foaf:interest and sioc:topic can be used to describe a given person\'s topics of interest. If the person is a computer scientist and the model contains topics such as “Information Technology"" and “Sports"", the SPARQL queries would search for terms inserted in this context which are ambiguous. Furthermore, the property foaf:based_near may support the problem of idioms. Assuming that a user is located in a certain part of Russia and he is reading an English web page which contains some idioms, this property may be used to gather appropriate translations of idioms from English to Russian using a given RDF KB. Therefore, an MT system can be adapted to a user by using specific data about him in RDF along with given KBs. Recently, Moussallem et al BIBREF16 have released a multilingual linked idioms dataset as a first part of supporting the investigation of this suggestion. The dataset contains idioms in 5 languages and are represented by knowledge graphs which facilitates the retrieval and inference of translations among the idioms.', 'Translating KBs. According to our research, it is clear that SWT may be used for translating KBs in order to be applied in MT systems. For instance, some content provided by the German Wikipedia version are not contained in the Portuguese one. Therefore, the semantic structure (i.e., triples) provided by DBpedia versions of these respective Wikipedia versions would be able to help translate from German to Portuguese. For example, the terms contained in triples would be translated to a given target language using a dictionary containing domain words. This dictionary may be acquired in two different ways. First, by performing localisation, as in the work by J. P. McCrae BIBREF17 which translates the terms contained in a monolingual ontology, thus generating a bilingual ontology. Second, by creating embeddings of both DBpedia versions in order to determine the similarity between entities through their vectors. This insight is supported by some recent works, such as Ristoski et al. BIBREF18 , which creates bilingual embeddings using RDF based on Word2vec algorithms. Therefore, we suggest investigating an MT approach mainly based on SWT using NN for translating KBs. Once the KBs are translated, we suggest including them in the language models for improving the translation of entities.']","1.

Our goal was to present the current open MT translation problems and how SWT can address these problems and enhance MT quality. Considering the decision power of SWT, they cannot be ignored by future MT systems. As a next step, we intend to continue elaborating a novel MT approach which is capable of simultaneously gathering knowledge from different SW resources and consequently being able to address the ambiguity of named entities and also contribute to the OOV words problem. This insight relies on our recent works, such as BIBREF15 , which have augmented NMT models with the usage of external knowledge for improving the translation of entities in texts. Additionally, future works that can be expected from fellow researchers, include the creation of multilingual linguistic ontologies describing the syntax of rich morphologically languages for supporting MT approaches. Also, the creation of more RDF multilingual dictionaries which can improve some MT steps, such as alignment.', 'The real benefit of SW comes from its capacity to provide unseen knowledge about emergent data, which appears every day. Therefore, we suggest performing the topic-modelling technique over the source text to provide a necessary context before translation. Instead of applying the topic-modeling over the entire text, we would follow the principle of communication (i.e from 3 to 5 sentences for describing an idea and define a context for each piece of text. Thus, at the execution of a translation model in a given SMT, we would focus on every word which may be a homonymous or polysemous word. For every word which has more than one translation, a SPARQL query would be required to find the best combination in the current context. Thus, at the translation phase, the disambiguation algorithm could search for an appropriate word using different SW resources such as DBpedia, in consideration of the context provided by the topic modelling. The goal is to exploit the use of more than one SW resource at once for improving the translation of ambiguous terms. The use of two or more SW resources simultaneously has not yet been investigated.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.1581108829568788,0.7749718046991845,100.00000000000004,0.07013574660633484,1.8625749719408458,1.0,"
    Semantic Web technologies are promising opportunities for progress in Machine Translation because they can be implemented in a variety of ways according to each MT approach. Named Entities and Non-standard speech are two of the most important problems in MT and they are well suited to be solved with the help of SWT.

    We believe that a massive amount of data may be collected in the future from social media and user logs about their individual interests and language models could be customised to each user. Moreover, KBs could be translated to other languages using SWT.

    The opportunities presented by the use of Semantic Web technologies in Machine Translation are promising, but they need to be studied more in-depth.

Recently, Popović BIBREF3 has classified five types of errors that still remain in MT systems. According to research, the two main faults that are responsible for 40% and 30% of problems respectively, are reordering errors and lexical and syntactic ambiguity. Thus, addressing these barriers is a key challenge for modern translation systems. A large number of MT approaches have been developed over the years that could potentially serve as a remedy. For instance, translators began by using methodologies based on linguistics which led to the family of RBMT. However, RBMT systems have a critical drawback in their reliance on manually crafted rules, thus making the development of new translation modules for different languages even more difficult.', 'SW has already shown its capability for semantic disambiguation of polysemous and homonymous words. However, SWT were applied in two ways to support the semantic disambiguation in MT. First, the ambiguous words were recognized in the source text before carrying out the translation, applying a pre-editing technique. Second, SWT were applied to the output translation in the target language as a post-editing technique. Although applying one of these techniques has increased the quality of a translation, both techniques are tedious to implement when they have to translate common words instead of named entities, then be applied several times to achieve a successful translation.', 'On the other hand, there is also a syntactic disambiguation problem which as yet lacks good solutions. For instance, the English language contains irregular verbs like “set” or “put”. Depending on the structure of a sentence, it is not possible to recognize their verbal tense, e.g., present or past tense. Even statistical approaches trained on huge corpora may fail to find the exact meaning of some words due to the structure of the language. Although this challenge has successfully been dealt with since NMT has been used for European languages, implementations of NMT for some non-European languages have not been fully exploited (e.g., Brazilian Portuguese, Latin-America Spanish, Zulu, Hindi) due to the lack of large bilingual data sets on the Web to be trained on. Thus, we suggest gathering relationships among properties within an ontology by using the reasoning technique for handling this issue. For instance, the sentence “Anna usually put her notebook on the table for studying"" may be annotated using a certain vocabulary and represented by triples. Thus, the verb “put"", which is represented by a predicate that groups essential information about the verbal tense, may support the generation step of a given MT system. This sentence usually fails when translated to rich morphological languages, such as Brazilian-Portuguese and Arabic, for which the verb influences the translation of “usually"" to the past tense. In this case, a reasoning technique may support the problem of finding a certain rule behind relationships between source and target texts in the alignment phase (training phase). However, a well-known problem of reasoners is the poor run-time performance. Therefore, this run-time deficiency needs to be addressed or minimized before implementing reasoners successfully into MT systems.', 'Named Entities.

To maintain good performance of hard attention as well as the advantage of end-to-end trainability of soft attention, we introduce a local variance loss to encourage the model to put most of the attention on just a few parts of input states at each decoding step. Additionally, we propose a global variance loss to directly optimize the attention from the global perspective by preventing assigning high weights to the same locations multiple times. The global variance loss is somewhat similar with the coverage mechanism BIBREF10, BIBREF11, which is also designed for solving the repetition problem. The coverage mechanism introduces a coverage vector to keep track of previous decisions at each decoding step and adds it into the attention calculation. However, when the high attention on certain position is wrongly assigned during previous timesteps, the coverage mechanism hinders the correct assignment of attention in later steps.', 'To avoid the model attending to the same parts of the input states repeatedly, we propose another variance loss to adjust the attention distribution globally. Ideally, the same locations should be assigned a relatively high attention weight once at most. Different from the coverage mechanism BIBREF11, BIBREF10 tracking attention distributions of previous timesteps, we maintain the sum of attention distributions over all decoder timesteps, denoted as $A$. The $i$-th value of $A$ represents the accumulated attention that the input state at $i$-th position has received throughout the whole decoding process. Without repeated high attention being paid to the same location, the difference between the sum of attention weight and maximum attention weight of $i$-th input state among all timesteps should be small. Moreover, the whole distribution of the difference over all input positions should have a flat shape. Similar to the definition of local variance loss, the global variance loss is formulated as:', 'We further evaluate how these optimization approaches work. The results at the bottom of Table TABREF13 verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

            It is difficult to give a definitive answer to this question without reviewing the entire paper, but a quick overview of the paper passages suggests that they mention a number of potential additional data sources that could be used to improve the performance of an NLP system.

            For example, they mention that adding data from multiple languages can help to improve the quality of the system. This is because different languages may have different ways of expressing the same concept, which can lead to inconsistencies in the system's predictions.

            They also mention that adding data from human translations can help to improve the performance of the system. This is because human translations are typically more accurate than machine translations, and can help to improve the quality of the system's predictions.

            Finally, they mention that adding data from multiple domains can help to improve the performance of the system. This is because different domains may have different ways of expressing the same concept, which can lead to inconsistencies in the system's predictions.

            Ultimately, the answer to the question about how much additional data they manage to generate from translations will depend on the specific context and goals of the NLP system being developed.

However, with the high number of parameters to be trained in more and more complicated deep neural network architectures, the demand of more reliable annotated data has become even more urgent. Data extension has been a longstanding goal in implicit discourse classification. BIBREF10 proposed to differentiate typical and atypical examples for each relation and augment training data for implicit only by typical explicits. BIBREF11 designed criteria for selecting explicit samples in which connectives can be omitted without changing the interpretation of the discourse. More recently, BIBREF0 proposed a pipeline to automatically label English implicit discourse samples based on explicitation of discourse connectives during human translating in parallel corpora, and achieve substantial improvements in classification. Our work here directly extended theirs by employing document-aligned cross-lingual parallel corpora and majority votes to get more reliable and in-topic annotated implicit discourse relation instances.', ' BIBREF0 however only used a single target langauge (French), and had no control over the quality of the labels extracted from back-translated connectives. In this paper, we therefore systematically compare the contribution of three target translation languages from different language families: French (a Romance language), German (from the Germanic language family) and Czech (a Slavic language).

While many approaches to automatic discourse relation detection (DRD) have been proposed in the past, they have not been able to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we propose the neural network based approach to discover implicit discourse relations (IDRs) in sentence pairs. IDRs are a kind of implicit relations, which are not explicitly expressed but are inferred from context.

For example, When spontaneous protests occur just after recent news such as increasing taxes or decreasing budget, we need to have indicators to raise the flag of a happening protest. Identifying these indicators requires to select a set of words that are mostly associated with the events of interest such as protests. We then track the volume of these words and evaluate the probability of an event occurring given the current volume of each of the tracked features. The main challenge is to find this set of features that allow such probabilistic classification.', 'In this paper, we propose a method to find the best word-pairs to represent the events of interest. These word-pairs can be used for time series analysis to predict future events as indicated in Figure FIGREF1 . They can also be used as seeds for topic modelling, or to find related posts and word-pairs using dynamic query expansion. The proposed framework uses a temporal filter to identify the spikes within the word-pair signal to binarize the word-pair time series vector BIBREF3 . The binary vector of the word-pair is compared to the protest days vector using Jaccard similarity index BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , where the word-pairs with highest similarity scores are the most associated word-pairs with protest days. This feature selection method is built upon the assumption that people discuss an event on the day of that event more than on any day before or after the event. This implies that word-pairs related to the event will form a spike on this specific day. Some of the spiking word-pairs are related to the nature of the event itself, such as “taxi protest” or “fair education”. These word-pairs will appear once or twice along the time frame. Meanwhile, more generic word-pairs such as “human rights” or “labour strike” will spike more frequently in the days of events regardless the protest nature.', 'Event detection is important for emergency services to react rapidly and minimize damage. For example, terrorist attacks, protests, or bushfires may require the presence of ambulances, firefighters, and police as soon as possible to save people. This research aims to detect events as soon as they occur and are reported via some Twitter user. The event detection process requires to know the keywords associated with each event and to assess the minimal count of each word to decide confidently that an event has occurred. In this research, we propose a novel method of spike matching to identify keywords, and use probabilistic classification to assess the probability of having an event given the volume of each word.', 'According to the distributional semantic hypothesis, event-related words are likely to be used on the day of an event more frequently than any normal day before or after the event. This will form a spike in the keyword count magnitude along the timeline as illustrated in Figure FIGREF6 . To find the words most associated with events, we search for the words that achieve the highest number of spikes matching the days of events. We use the Jaccard similarity metric as it values the spikes matching events and penalizes spikes with no event and penalizes events without spikes. Separate words can be noisy due to the misuse of the term by people, especially in big data environments. So, we rather used the word-pairs as textual features in order to capture the context of the word. For example, this can differentiate between the multiple usages of the word “strike” within the contexts of “lightning strike”, “football strike” and “labour strike”', 'Keywords can be selected as features as a single term or a word-pair or a skip-grams, which can be used for classification using multiple methods such as mutual information, TF-IDF, INLINEFORM0 , or traditional statistical methods such as ANOVA or correlation. Our problem faces two challenges: the first is the huge number of word-pairs extracted from all tweets for the whole time frame concurrently, which make some techniques such as TF-IDF and INLINEFORM1 computationally unfeasible as they require the technique to be distributable on parallel processors on a cluster. The second challenge is the temporal nature of the data which require some techniques that can capture the distributional semantics of terms along with the ground truth vector.

First, Ji and Bhatia used a pretrained model (not fully optimal for some parts of the given task) in their pipeline; Ji's model performed worse than the baseline on the categorization of legislative bills, which is thought to be due to legislative discourse structures differing from those of the training set (WSJ corpus).

Our dataset comes from the Arabic author profiling and deception detection shared task (APDA) BIBREF0. We focus on building simple models using pre-trained bidirectional encoders from transformers(BERT) BIBREF1 under various data conditions. Our results show (1) the utility of augmenting training data, and (2) the benefit of using majority votes from our simple classifiers.', 'In the rest of the paper, we introduce the dataset, followed by our experimental conditions and results. We then provide a literature review and conclude.', 'As explained earlier, the shared task is set up at the user level where the age, dialect, and gender of each user are the required predictions. In our experiments, we first model the task at the tweet level and then port these predictions at the user level. For our core modelling, we fine-tune BERT on the shared task data. We also introduce an additional in-house dataset labeled with dialect and gender tags to the task as we will explain below. As a baseline, we use a small gated recurrent units (GRU) model. We now introduce our tweet-level models.', ""To further improve the performance of our models, we introduce in-house labeled data that we use to fine-tune BERT. For the gender classification task, we manually label an in-house dataset of 1,100 users with gender tags, including 550 female users, 550 male users. We obtain 162,829 tweets by crawling the 1,100 users' timelines. We combine this new gender dataset with the gender TRAIN data (from shared task) to obtain an extended dataset, to which we refer as EXTENDED_Gender. For the dialect identification task, we randomly sample 20,000 tweets for each class from an in-house dataset gold labeled with the same 15 classes as the shared task. In this way, we obtain 298,929 tweets (Sudan only has 18,929 tweets). We combine this new dialect data with the shared task dialect TRAIN data to form EXTENDED_Dialect. For both the dialect and gender tasks, we fine-tune BERT on EXTENDED_Dialect and EXTENDED_Gender independently and report performance on DEV. We refer to this iteration of experiments as BERT_EXT. As Table TABREF7 shows, BERT_EXT is 2.18% better than BERT for dialect and 0.75% better than BERT for gender.""]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.2489959839357429,0.2036098645307481,100.00000000000004,0.07142857142857141,0.6292424664033717,1.0,"

In each run, we select the best hyperparameter combination or early-stopping checkpoint based on each of the five compared metrics. Human evaluation is then employed to identify the best choice. We evaluate the performance of each metric by how many times (out of 10) they succeeded in selecting the best hyperparameter combination or early-stopping checkpoint (out of 4) and the average human-annotated score for their selected models.', 'By transferring pretrained natural language understanding knowledge from BERT and fine-tuning with strong and weak supervision examples and human preference annotations, our model correlates better with human judgment than other compared metrics.

Our model, in contrast, is much more reliable when performing these choices.', 'The results are shown in Table 3. We can see that conventional automated metrics perform poorly and result in sub-optimal result when performing hyperparameter search and selecting the best performing checkpoints. Converting evaluation metric from BLEU or perplexity to the proposed comparative evaluator can yield non-neglectable improvements without changing model architecture or training objective.

We see a similar trend: performance in imdb400 is substantially better than yelp50. In fact we see almost no decrease in fluency in the adversarial examples compared to the original in imdb400. In yelp50, HotFlip and AutoEncoder are fairly competitive, producing adversarial examples that are only marginally less fluent compared to the original at T0. At T2, however, these methods begin to trade off fluency. All in all, the paraphrasability and fluency surveys suggest that imdb400 is an easier dataset for adversarial experiments, and it is the predominant dataset used by most studies.', 'We present the performance of the attacking methods against 3 target classifiers (Table TABREF23A; top) and on 3 datasets (Table TABREF23B; bottom). We choose 3 ACC thresholds for the attacking performance: T0, T1 and T2, which correspond approximately to accuracy scores of 90%, 80% and 70% for the Yelp datasets (yelp50, yelp200); and 80%, 70% and 50% for the IMDB datasets (imdb400). Each method is tuned accordingly to achieve a particular accuracy. Missing numbers (dashed lines) indicate the method is unable to produce the desired accuracy, e.g. HotFlip with only 1 word flip produces 81.5% accuracy (T1) when attacking CNN on yelp50, and so T0 accuracy is unachievable.', 'We propose an evaluation framework for assessing the quality of adversarial examples in NLP, based on four criteria: (a) attacking performance, (b) textual similarity; (c) fluency; (d) label preservation. Our framework involves both automatic and human evaluation, and we test 5 benchmark methods and a novel auto-encoder approach. We found that the architecture of the target classifier is an important factor when it comes to attacking performance, e.g. CNNs are more vulnerable than LSTMs; dataset features such as length of text, training data size (for target classifiers) and input domains are also influencing factors that affect how difficulty it is to perform adversarial attack; and the predominant dataset (IMDB) used by most studies is comparatively easy for adversarial attack. Lastly, we also observe in our human evaluation that on shorter texts (Yelp) these methods produce adversarial examples that tend not to preserve their semantic content and have low readability. More importantly, these methods also “cheat” by simply flipping the sentiment in the adversarial examples, and this behaviour is evident on both datasets, suggesting they could be ineffective for adversarial training.', 'Table 2: Results based on automatic metrics.

            A5. TP-N2F is much faster than LSTM-based seq2seq in both training and inference.
            The TP-N2F Decoder is an RNN that takes the output from the reasoning MLP as its initial hidden state for generating a sequence of relational tuples (Figure FIGREF13). This decoder contains an attentional LSTM called the Tuple-LSTM which feeds an unbinding module: attention operates on the context vector of the encoder, consisting of all individual encoder outputs $\lbrace ^t \rbrace $.

Each operation is regarded as a relational tuple by viewing the operator as relation, e.g., $(add, n1, n2)$. We test TP-N2F for this task on the MathQA dataset BIBREF16. The MathQA dataset consists of about 37k math word problems, each with a corresponding list of multi-choice options and the corresponding operation sequence. In this task, TP-N2F is deployed to generate the operation sequence given the question. The generated operations are executed with the execution script from BIBREF16 to select a multi-choice answer. As there are about 30% noisy data (where the execution script returns the wrong answer when given the ground-truth program; see Sec. SECREF20 of the Appendix), we report both execution accuracy (of the final multi-choice answer after running the execution engine) and operation sequence accuracy (where the generated operation sequence must match the ground truth sequence exactly). TP-N2F is compared to a baseline provided by the seq2prog model in BIBREF16, an LSTM-based seq2seq model with attention. Our model outperforms both the original seq2prog, designated SEQ2PROG-orig, and the best reimplemented seq2prog after an extensive hyperparameter search, designated SEQ2PROG-best. Table TABREF16 presents the results. To verify the importance of the TP-N2F encoder and decoder, we conducted experiments to replace either the encoder with a standard LSTM (denoted LSTM2TP) or the decoder with a standard attentional LSTM (denoted TP2LSTM).

After the first unbinding step (SECREF7), i.e., the inner product of $^t$ with $^{\\prime }_i$, we get tensors $_{i}^t$ (SECREF12).

A relational unbinding vector $_{rel}^{\\prime t}$ is computed by a linear function from the sum of the $_{i}^t$ and used to compute the inner product with each $_i^t$ to yield $_i^t$, which are treated as the embedding of argument vectors (SECREF12). Based on the TPR theory, $_{rel}^{\\prime t}$ is passed to a linear function to get $_{rel}^t$ as the embedding of a relation vector.

    In this work, we investigate the design principles for expressive NLP models. Using a novel approach called TP-N2F (Transition-based Neural Network to Function), we find that expressive models like Seq2Seq can be effectively expressed through a transition-based network. The TP-N2F model has a different design principle from other neural network models. We propose a new optimization objective for Transition-based N2F, and show that it not only improves the performance of expressive models like Seq2Seq, but also results in faster training and inference speed. We also show that the TP-N2F model is applicable to a variety of NLP tasks such as machine translation, question answering, and code generation.

Given a natural-language query, we need to generate code containing function calls with parameters. Each function call is a relational tuple, which has a function as the relation and parameters as arguments. We evaluate our model on the AlgoLisp dataset for this task and achieve state-of-the-art performance. The AlgoLisp dataset BIBREF17 is a program synthesis dataset. Each sample contains a problem description, a corresponding Lisp program tree, and 10 input-output testing pairs. We parse the program tree into a straight-line sequence of tuples (same style as in MathQA). AlgoLisp provides an execution script to run the generated program and has three evaluation metrics: the accuracy of passing all test cases (Acc), the accuracy of passing 50% of test cases (50p-Acc), and the accuracy of generating an exactly matching program (M-Acc). AlgoLisp has about 10% noisy data (details in the Appendix), so we report results both on the full test set and the cleaned test set (in which all noisy testing samples are removed). TP-N2F is compared with an LSTM seq2seq with attention model, the Seq2Tree model in BIBREF17, and a seq2seq model with a pre-trained tree decoder from the Tree2Tree autoencoder (SAPS) reported in BIBREF18.

Ablation experiments with TP2LSTM and LSTM2TP show that, for this task, the TP-N2F Decoder is more helpful than TP-N2F Encoder.

Thus, images can be used to learn that these words have similar semantic content. Importantly, image-text data is generally available on the internet even for low-resource languages.

Overcoming this data bottleneck is a key contribution of our work.', 'We have also identified a direction for future work: within language performance is weaker than the state-of-the-art, likely because our work leveraged only image-text data rather than a large monolingual corpus. Fortunately, our joint training approach provides a simple extension of our method for future work: multi-task joint training. For example, in a triple-task setting, we can simultaneously (1) constrain query and relevant image representations to be similar and (2) constrain word embeddings to be predictive of context in large monolingual corpora and (3) constrain representations for parallel text across languages to be similar. For the second task, implementing recent advances in producing monolingual embeddings, such as using subword information, is likely to improve results. Multilingual embeddings learned in a multi-task setting would reap both the benefits of our methods and existing methods for producing word embeddings. For example, while our method is likely to perform worse for more abstract words, when combined with existing approaches it is likely to achieve more consistent performance.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0808080808080808,0.4976852406340058,100.00000000000004,0.045454545454545456,0.7605497822189857,1.0,"

Our proposed process is based on the augmented cross-industry standard process for data mining BIBREF1 (augmented CRISP data mining cycle). In particular, we are interested in methods for improving a model after its deployment through re-ranking of the initial ranking results. In advance, we follow the steps of the CRISP cycle towards deployment for generating a state-of-the-art baseline QA model. First, we examine existing data (data understanding) and prepare a corpus for training (data preparation). Second, we implement and train a QA pipeline using state-of-the-art open source components (modelling). We perform an evaluation using different amounts of data and different pipeline configurations (evaluation), also to understand the nature of the data and the application (business understanding). Third, we investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of re-ranking in improving our QA pipeline after the deployment phase of CRISP. Adaptivity after deployment is modelled as (automatic) operationalisation step with external reflection based on, e.g., user feedback. This could be replaced by introspective meta-models that allow the system to enhance itself by metacognition BIBREF1 .

Question: How does the work relate to previous work on online hate in social media?

Paper passages:

As mentioned, our work is related to an increasing number of research on hate speech detection. Specifically, there are two main groups of research which are rule-based approaches and machine learning approaches. In rule-based approaches, researchers manually construct rules to detect hate speech in social media. For instance, some researchers attempted to automatically construct rules to detect hate speech in Twitter. For example, Waseem et al.BIBREF5 manually constructed a set of keywords and created a set of rules to detect hate speech in Twitter. However, as Waseem et al.BIBREF5 show, some keywords are not sufficient to distinguish",0.41452297593556875,0.3393213572854292

The automatic segmentation results were generated by the segmenter trained on training data of OntoNotes. Methods of the ""No seg"" group are character-based. From the table, we can obtain several informative observations. First, by replacing the gold segmentation with the automatically generated segmentation, the F1-score of the Word-based (LSTM) + char + bichar model decreased from 75.77% to 71.70%. This shows the problem of the practice that treats the predicted word segmentation result as the true one for the word-based Chinese NER. Second, the Char-based (LSTM)+bichar+ExSoftword model achieved a 71.89% to 72.40% improvement over the Char-based (LSTM)+bichar+softword baseline on the F1-score. This indicates the feasibility of the naive extension of ExSoftword to softword. However, it still greatly underperformed Lattice-LSTM, showing its deficiency in utilizing word information. Finally, our proposed method, which is a further extension of Exsoftword, obtained a statistically significant improvement over Lattice-LSTM and even performed similarly to those word-based methods with gold segmentation, verifying its effectiveness on this data set.', 'Table TABREF34 shows the inference speed of our method when implementing the sequnece modeling layer with the LSTM-based, CNN-based, and Transformer-based architecture, respectively. The speed was evaluated by average sentences per second using a GPU (NVIDIA TITAN X). For a fair comparison with Lattice-LSTM and LR-CNN, we set the batch size of our method to 1 at inference time. From the table, we can see that our method has a much faster inference speed than Lattice-LSTM when using the LSTM-based sequence modeling layer, and it was also much faster than LR-CNN, which used an CNN architecture to implement the sequence modeling layer. And as expected, our method with the CNN-based sequence modeling layer showed some advantage in inference speed than those with the LSTM-based and Transformer-based sequence model layer.', 'Table TABREF42 shows results on Weibo NER, where NE, NM, and Overall denote F1-scores for named entities, nominal entities (excluding named entities) and both, respectively.

In summary, our method mainly contains the following four steps. Firstly, we scan each input sentence with the word lexicon, obtaining the four 'BMES' word sets for each character of the sentence. Secondly, we look up the frequency of each word counted on the statistic data set. Thirdly, we obtain the vector representation of the four word sets of each character according to Eq.

The first principle of our method design is to achieve a fast inference speed. To this end, we propose to encoding the matched words, obtained from the lexicon, into the representations of characters. Compared with Lattice-LSTM, this method is more concise and easier to implement. It can avoid complicated model architecture design thus has much faster inference speed. It can also be quickly adapted to any appropriate neural architectures without redesign. Given an existing neural character-based NER model, we only have to modify its character representation layer to successfully introduce the word lexicon.

    There are a number of challenges that hinder the use of NLP techniques for other languages. On the one hand, the lack of annotated training data is an issue. To train a model, it requires a large amount of data. However, due to the lack of annotated data, it is hard to obtain enough data to train the model. Additionally, the model needs to be able to handle the linguistic features of the target language. This can be a challenge to train the model properly.

    Another challenge is the lack of annotation guidelines. This makes it hard to ensure that the annotations are of good quality. Additionally, it is hard to determine the correct annotation for a specific text.

    Finally, the model needs to be able to handle the cultural differences between the target language and English. This can be a challenge to train the model properly.

    We have chosen a dataset that contains both English and Danish texts. This will allow us to compare the performance of the model on both languages. However, it is important to note that the dataset is not balanced. This means that there are more English texts than Danish texts in the dataset. This can affect the results of the evaluation.

            Question: How many categories of offensive language were there?

            Paper passages:
            Offensive content is broken into three sub-tasks to be able to effectively identify both the type and the target of the offensive posts. These three sub-tasks are chosen with the objective of being able to capture different types of offensive language, such as hate speech and cyberbullying (section ""Background"" ).
            Many different sub-tasks have been considered in the literature on offensive and harmful language detection, ranging from the detection of general offensive language to more refined tasks such as hate speech detection BIBREF2 , and cyberbullying detection BIBREF6 .
            Offensive language varies greatly, ranging from simple profanity to much more severe types of language. One of the more troublesome types of language is hate speech and the presence of hate speech on social media platforms has been shown to be in correlation with hate crimes in real life settings BIBREF1 .

One of the more troublesome types of language is hate speech and the presence of hate speech on social media platforms has been shown to be in correlation with hate crimes in real life settings BIBREF1 . It can be quite hard to distinguish between generally offensive language and hate speech as few universal definitions exist BIBREF2 . There does, however, seem to be a general consensus that hate speech can be defined as language that targets a group with the intent to be harmful or to cause social chaos. This targeting is usually done on the basis of some characteristics such as race, color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality or religion BIBREF3 . In section ""Background"" , hate speech is defined in more detail. Offensive language, on the other hand, is a more general category containing any type of profanity or insult. Hate speech can, therefore, be classified as a subset of offensive language. BIBREF0 propose guidelines for classifying offensive language as well as the type and the target of offensive language. These guidelines capture the characteristics of generally offensive language, hate speech and other types of targeted offensive language such as cyberbullying. However, despite offensive language detection being a burgeoning field, no dataset yet exists for Danish BIBREF4 despite this phenomenon being present BIBREF5 .', 'Contradicting definitions. It becomes clear that one of the key challenges in doing meaningful research on the topic are the differences in both the annotation-schemas and the definitions used, since it makes it difficult to effectively compare results to existing work, as pointed out by several authors ( BIBREF13 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF0 ). These issues become clear when comparing the work of BIBREF6 , where racist and sexist remarks are classified as a subset of insults, to the work of BIBREF15 , where similar remarks are split into two categories; hate speech and derogatory language. Another clear example of conflicting definitions becomes visible when comparing BIBREF16 , where hate speech is considered without any consideration of overlaps with the more general type of offensive language, to BIBREF2 where a clear distinction is made between the two, by classifying posts as either Hate speech, Offensive or Neither. This lack of consensus led BIBREF14 to propose annotation guidelines and introduce a typology. BIBREF17 argue that these proposed guidelines do not effectively capture both the type and target of the offensive language.', 'Other (OTH): The target of the offensive language does not fit the criteria of either of the previous two categories.

The models are trained for 30 epochs with check-pointing; only the check-point with the best performance on the development set is kept for testing. We dynamically set the mini-batch size INLINEFORM0 as a function of the number of examples INLINEFORM1 such that the number of training iterations is roughly 300 per epoch (and also constant regardless of training data size); concretely, INLINEFORM2 . As a form of regularization, we apply dropout BIBREF14 at a rate of 50% on the hidden representations immediately after a Bi-LSTM or CNN composition. The outcome objectives are trained such that the gradients of the context encoder weights are downscaled by an order of magnitude (i.e., one tenth) to encourage learning at the later layers. When learning on the NER objective – the main branch of the network – the gradients are not downscaled in the same manner. Moreover, when training on the NER objective, we upweight the loss penalty on “relation” tags (non-O tags) by a factor of 10, which forces the model to prioritize differentiation between different types of interactions over span segmentation. We additionally upweight the loss penalty by a factor of 3 on Training-22 examples compared to NLM-180 examples. We optimize using the Adam BIBREF15 optimization method. These hyper-parameters were tuned during initial experiments.', 'Eight teams participated in task 1 while four teams participated in task 2. We record the relative performance of our system (among others in the top 5) on the two official test sets in Table TABREF24 . For each team, we only display the performance of the best run for a particular test set. Methods are grouped by the data used for training and ranked in ascending order of primary relation extraction performance followed by entity recognition performance. We also included a single model trained solely on Training-22, that was not submitted, for comparison. Our voting-based ensemble performed best among the three systems submitted by our team on both NER and relation extraction. In the official challenge, this model placed second overall on both NER and relation extraction.', 'While precision was similar between the three systems (with exceptions), we observed that our ensemble-based system benefited mostly from improved recall. This aligns with our initial expectation (based on prior experience with deep learning models) that an ensemble-based approach would improve stability and accuracy with deep neural models. Although including NLM-180 as training data resulted in significant performance gains during 11-fold cross validation, we find that the same improvements were not as dramatic on either test sets despite the 800% gain in training data. As such, we offer the following analysis. First, we suspect that there may be a semantic or annotation drift between these datasets as annotation guidelines evolve over time and as annotators become more experienced. To our knowledge, the datasets were annotated in the following order: NLM-180, Training-22, and finally Test Sets 1 and 2; moreover, Test Sets 1 and 2 were annotated by separate groups of annotators. Second, having few but higher quality examples may be more advantageous than having many but lower quality examples, at least for this particular task where evaluation is based on matching exact character offsets. Finally, we note that the top performing system exhibits superior performance on Test Set 1 compared to Test Set 2; interestingly, we observe an inverse of the scenario in our own system. This may be an indicator that our system struggles with data that is more “sparse” (as previously defined in Section SECREF2 ).', 'We present the results of our initial experiments in Table TABREF20 . Evaluations were produced as as result of 11-fold cross-validation over Training-22 with two drug labels per fold. Instead of macro-averaging over folds, and thereby weighting each fold equally, we evaluate on the union of all 11 test-fold predictions.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.3529411764705882,0.6822212667612308,100.00000000000004,0.13545816733067728,0.7549237233922038,1.0,"

We evaluate using both the same-different measures from above, as well as the ABX phone discriminability task BIBREF40 used in the zrsc and other recent work BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 . The ABX task evaluates phoneme discriminability using minimal pairs: sequences of three phonemes where the central phoneme differs between the two sequences INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 in the pair, such as b ih n and b eh n. Feature representations are then evaluated on how well they can identify a third triplet INLINEFORM2 as having the same phoneme sequence as either INLINEFORM3 or INLINEFORM4 . See BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 for details on how the scores are computed and averaged over speakers and phonemes to obtain the final ABX error rate. One usually distinguishes between the within-speaker error rate where all three triplets belong to the same speaker, and the cross-speaker error rate where INLINEFORM5 and INLINEFORM6 are from the same and INLINEFORM7 from a different speaker.', 'In this work we investigated different representations obtained using data from the target language alone (i.e., fully unsupervised) and from multilingual supervised systems trained on labeled data from non-target languages. We found that the cae, a recent neural approach to unsupervised subword modeling, learns complementary information to the more traditional approach of vtln. This suggests that vtln should also be considered by other researchers using neural approaches. On the other hand, our best results were achieved using multilingual bnfs. These results are competitive with state-of-the-art features learned from target language data only BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , but have the advantage of a much smaller dimensionality. In addition, it is easy to control the dimensionality of the bnfs, unlike in the nonparametric models of BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , and this allowed us to use them in the downstream task of word segmentation and clustering. We observed consistent improvements from bnfs across all metrics in this downstream task, and other work demonstrates that these features are also useful for downstream keyword spotting in settings with very small amounts of labeled data BIBREF45 . We also showed that it is theoretically possible to further improve bnfs with language-specific fine-tuning, and we hope to explore models that can do this more reliably than the cae in the future.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.6326129666011788,0.2380102499827308,100.00000000000004,0.02253521126760563,0.11013113815772804,1.0,"

Among all of the tools, the most popular and well accepted one is Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) Scale BIBREF15. This is a psychometric scale that assesses risk taking in five content domains: financial decisions (separately for investing versus gambling), health/safety, recreational, ethical, and social decisions. Respondents rate the likelihood that they would engage in domain-specific risky activities (Part I). An optional Part II assesses respondents' perceptions of the magnitude of the risks and expected benefits of the activities judged in Part I. There are more scales that are used in risky behavior analysis of individual's daily activities such as, The Berlin Social Support Scales (BSSS) BIBREF16 and Values In Action Scale (VIAS) BIBREF17. Dryhootch America BIBREF18, BIBREF19, a veteran peer support community organization, chooses 5, 6 and 5 questions respectively from the above mentioned survey systems to assess the PTSD among war veterans and consider rest of them as irrelevant to PTSD. The details of dryhootch chosen survey scale are stated in Table TABREF13. Table!TABREF14 shows a sample DOSPERT scale demographic chosen by dryhootch.

Unlike the previous twitter based mental health assessment tools, LAXARY provides a clinically interpretable model which can provide better classification accuracy and intensity of PTSD assessment and can easily obtain the trust of clinicians. The central challenge of LAXARY is to search twitter users from twitter search engine and manually label them for analysis. While developing PTSD Linguistic Dictionary, although we followed exactly same development idea of LIWC WordStat dictionary and tested reliability and validity, our dictionary was not still validated by domain experts as PTSD detection is highly sensitive issue than stress/depression detection. Moreover, given the extreme challenges of searching veterans in twitter using our selection and inclusion criteria, it was extremely difficult to manually find the evidence of the self-claimed PTSD sufferers. Although, we have shown extremely promising initial findings about the representation of a blackbox model into clinically trusted tools, using only 210 users' data is not enough to come up with a trustworthy model. Moreover, more clinical validation must be done in future with real clinicians to firmly validate LAXARY model provided PTSD assessment outcomes. In future, we aim to collect more data and run not only nationwide but also international-wide data collection to establish our innovation into a real tool. Apart from that, as we achieved promising results in detecting PTSD and its intensity using only twitter data, we aim to develop Linguistic Dictionary for other mental health issues too. Moreover, we will apply our proposed method in other types of mental illness such as depression, bipolar disorder, suicidal ideation and seasonal affective disorder (SAD) etc. As we know, accuracy of particular social media analysis depends on the dataset mostly. We aim to collect more data engaging more researchers to establish a set of mental illness specific Linguistic Database and evaluation technique to solidify the genralizability of our proposed method."", ""We use the exact similar method of LIWC to extract $\\alpha $-scores for each dimension and categories except we use our generated PTSD Linguistic Dictionary for the task BIBREF23. Thus we have total 16 $\\alpha $-scores in total. Meanwhile, we propose a new type of feature in this regard, which we called scaling-score ($s$-score). $s$-score is calculated from $\\alpha $-scores. The purpose of using $s$-score is to put exact scores of each of the dimension and category thus we can apply the same method used in real weekly survey system. The idea is, we divide each category into their corresponding scale factor (i.e., for DOSPERT scale, BSSS scale and VIAS scales) and divide them into 8, 3 and 5 scaling factors which are used in real survey system. Then we set the $s$-score from the scaling factors from the $\\alpha $-scores of the corresponding dimension of the questions. The algorithm is stated in Figure FIGREF23. Following Fig FIGREF23, we calculate the $s$-score for each dimension. Then we add up all the $s$-score of the dimensions to calculate cumulative $s$-score of particular categories which is displayed in Fig FIGREF22. Finally, we have total 32 features among them 16 are $\\alpha $-scores and 16 are $s$-scores for each category (i.e. each question). We add both of $\\alpha $ and $s$ scores together and scale according to their corresponding survey score scales using min-max standardization. Then, the final output is a 16 valued matrix which represent the score for each questions from three different Dryhootch surveys. We use the output to fill up each survey, estimate the prevalence of PTSD and its intensity based on each tool's respective evaluation metric."", ""To provide an initial results, we take 50% of users' last week's (the week they responded of having PTSD) data to develop PTSD Linguistic dictionary and apply LAXARY framework to fill up surveys on rest of 50% dataset.

As shown in Table TABREF48, our two models show competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art on the Visual Dialog challenge 2018 (DL-61 was the winner of the Visual Dialog challenge 2018). Specifically, our image-only model shows much higher NDCG score (60.16). On the other hand, our consensus dropout fusion model shows more balanced results over all metrics while still outperforming on most evaluation metrics (NDCG, MRR, R@1, and R@5). Compared to results of the Visual Dialog challenge 2019, our models also show strong results. Although ReDAN+ BIBREF26 and MReaL–BDAI show higher NDCG scores, our consensus dropout fusion model shows more balanced results over metrics while still having a competitive NDCG score compared to DAN BIBREF25, with rank 3 based on NDCG metric and high balance rank based on metric average.', 'In our models, the size of word vectors is 300, the dimension of visual feature is 2048, and hidden size of LSTM units which are used for encoders of questions, context history, and candidate answers is 512. We employ Adam BIBREF21 as the optimizer. We set the initial learning rate to 0.001 and decrease it by 0.0001 per epoch until 8th epoch and decay by 0.5 from 9th epoch on. For round dropout, we set the maximum number of history features to be dropped to 3 and we tune the p value to 0.25 for our instance dropout in the consensus dropout fusion module. Cross-entropy is used to calculate the loss.', ""Since NDCG measures more of a model's generalization ability (because it allows multiple similar answers), while the other metrics measure a model's preciseness, we interpret the results of these above experiments to mean that a model with more history information tends to predict correct answers by memorizing keywords or patterns in the history while a model with less history information (i.e., the image-only model) is better at generalization by avoiding relying on such exact-match extracted information. We think that an ideal model should have more balanced behavior and scores over all the metrics rather than having higher scores only for a certain metric and such a model could be considered as the one with both preciseness and generalization. To this end, we propose two models, an image-only and an image-history-joint model. We analyze that the answers these two models produce are complementarily good, and better at different metrics. Hence, we integrate these two models (image-only and image-history-joint) in two ways: consensus-dropout-fusion and ensemble. Our final consensus-dropout-fusion ensemble model scores strongly on both NDCG and recall metrics for the VisDial v1.0 test dataset, and these scores outperform the state-of-the-art of the Visual Dialog challenge 2018 on most metrics. Also, our model shows competitive balanced results in the Visual Dialog challenge 2019 (test-std leaderboard rank 3 based on NDCG metric and high balance across metrics)."", 'We first showed that current multimodal models on the Visual Dialog task over-rely on the dialogue history, and relatedly, image-only and image-history joint models achieve complementary performance gains. Hence, to balance the best abilities from each model, we proposed two ways of combining them: consensus dropout fusion and ensemble. Our consensus dropout fusion and ensemble model achieve strong ranks on multiple leaderboards. Specifically, the models show higher scores than the state-of-the-art results of the Visual Dialog challenge 2018 and more balanced scores than highest ranked results of the Visual Dialog challenge 2019.

Our pilot study demonstrates that such a model can pick up the relationship between languages purely from the data and the translation objective. We hypothesise that such a data-driven setup can be interesting for cross-linguistic studies and language typology. In the future, we would like to investigate the emerging language space in more detail also in connection with alternative network architectures and training procedures.

Our primary hypothesis is that we can increase the level of abstraction by including a larger diversity in the training data that pushes the model to improve compression of the growing variation and complexity of the task. We will test this hypothesis by training multilingual models over hundreds or even almost a thousand languages to force the MT model to abstract over a large proportion of the World's linguistic diversity."", 'Neural machine translation typically applies an end-to-end network architecture that includes one or several layers for encoding an input sentence into an internal dense real-valued vector representation and another layer for decoding that representation into the output of the target language.

An important requirement is that the model needs to support variable lengths of input and output.

It suggests that cross-context patterns were even more crucial for emerging contexts and entities than familiar entities, which might often be memorized by their surface forms. The paper passages also suggest that the inability of the prevalently used BiLSTM-CNN in modeling cross-contexts is mainly due to the lack of additive and multiplicative cross-structures.

    The paper “What are the characteristics of the city dialect?” [1] investigates the lexical variation in Spanish dialects using Twitter. The authors find that there are two main dialect regions in Spain, one in the urban areas and one in rural areas. The urban dialect is more similar to the standard Spanish language, while the rural dialect is more distinct. The urban dialect has more words that are specific to that region, while the rural dialect has more words that are common to many regions. The authors conclude that their results can be used to study the linguistic variation in Spanish dialects.

Furthermore, microblogging services provide us with real-time communication among users that, importantly, tend to employ an oral speech. Another difference with traditional approaches is that while the latter focus on male, rural informants, users of social platforms are likely to be young, urban people BIBREF4 , which opens the route to novel investigations on today's usage of language. Thanks to advances in geolocation, it is now possible to directly examine the diatopic properties of specific regions. Examples of computational linguistic works that investigate regional variation with Twitter or Facebook corpora thus far comprise English BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , Spanish BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , German BIBREF13 , Arabic BIBREF14 and Dutch BIBREF15 .

This way, the model is only exposed to the most likely words, thus reducing the chance of the model failing to recognize the input.


           

            Question: How do your backoff strategies help in improving the model performance?

            Answer:
            
            Our backoff strategies help in improving the model performance by replacing the generated word with a neutral word such as `a', which is not part of the vocabulary of the model. This way, the model is only exposed to the most likely words, thus reducing the chance of the model failing to recognize the input.




            Question: What does the term “sensitivity” mean in the context of the backoff strategies?

            Answer:
            
            The term “sensitivity” in the context of the backoff strategies means the percentage of words that the model predicts incorrectly","['1905.11268-Word Error Correction-3', '1905.11268-Introduction-5', '1905.11268-Robustness to adversarial attacks-9', '1905.11268-ScRNN with Backoff-4', '1905.11268-Robustness to adversarial attacks-10']","[""We calculate the word error rates (WER) of each of the models for different attacks and present our findings in Table 2 . Note that ATD incorrectly predicts $11.2$ words for every 100 words (in the `all' setting), whereas, all of the backoff variations of the ScRNN reconstruct better. The most accurate variant involves backing off to the background model, resulting in a low error rate of $6.9\\%$ , leading to the best performance on word recognition. This is a $32\\%$ relative error reduction compared to the vanilla ScRNN model with a pass-through backoff strategy. We can attribute the improved performance to the fact that there are $5.25\\%$ words in the test corpus that are unseen in the training corpus, and are thus only recoverable by backing off to a larger corpus. Notably, only training on the larger background corpus does worse, at $8.7\\%$ , since the distribution of word frequencies is different in the background corpus compared to the foreground corpus."", ""Third (our primary contribution), we propose a task-agnostic defense, attaching a word recognition model that predicts each word in a sentence given a full sequence of (possibly misspelled) inputs. The word recognition model's outputs form the input to a downstream classification model. Our word recognition models build upon the RNN-based semi-character word recognition model due to BIBREF7 . While our word recognizers are trained on domain-specific text from the task at hand, they often predict UNK at test time, owing to the small domain-specific vocabulary. To handle unobserved and rare words, we propose several backoff strategies including falling back on a generic word recognizer trained on a larger corpus. Incorporating our defenses, BERT models subject to 1-character attacks are restored to $88.3$ , $81.1$ , $78.0$ accuracy for swap, drop, add attacks respectively, as compared to $69.2$ , $63.6$ , and $50.0$ for adversarial training"", 'We observe additional gains by using background models as a backoff alternative, because of its lower word error rate (WER), especially, under the swap and drop attacks. However, these gains do not consistently translate in all other settings, as lower WER is necessary but not sufficient. Besides lower error rate, we find that a solid defense should furnish the attacker the fewest options to attack, i.e. it should have a low sensitivity.', ""Backoff to neutral word: Alternatively, noting that passing $\\colorbox {gray!20}{\\texttt {UNK}}$ -predicted words through unchanged exposes the downstream model to potentially corrupted text, we consider backing off to a neutral word like `a', which has a similar distribution across classes."", 'As we shall see in section § ""Understanding Model Sensitivity"" , the backoff neutral variation has the lowest sensitivity due to mapping UNK predictions to a fixed neutral word. Thus, it results in the highest robustness on most of the attack types for all four model classes.']","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.2900302114803625,1.078452947037362,100.00000000000004,0.14634146341463414,2.854853428864482,1.0,"
    Pass-through: word-recognizer passes on the (possibly misspelled) word as is.
    
    Backoff to neutral word: Alternatively, noting that passing $\colorbox {gray!20}{\texttt {UNK}}$ -predicted words through unchanged exposes the downstream model to potentially corrupted text, we consider backing off to a neutral word like `a', which has a similar distribution across classes.
    
    Backoff to background model: We also consider falling back upon a more generic word recognition model trained upon a larger, less-specialized corpus whenever the foreground word recognition model predicts UNK. Figure 1 depicts this scenario pictorially.

One feature is the number of words in the question. Intuitively, a longer question offers more information and we hypothesize additional information makes a question more precise. The remaining features come from two one-hot vectors describing each of the first two words in the question. Each one-hot vector is created using the learned vocabularies that define all possible words at the first and second word location of a question respectively (using training data, as described in the next section). Intuitively, early words in a question inform the type of answers that might be possible and, in turn, possible reasons/frequency for answer disagreement. For example, we expect “why is"" to regularly elicit many opinions and so disagreement. This intuition about the beginning words of a question is also supported by our analysis in the previous section which shows that different answer types yield different biases of eliciting answer agreement versus disagreement.', ""We train the system to predict (dis)agreement labels with training examples, where each example includes an image and question. At test time, given a novel visual question, the system outputs an unnormalized log probability indicating its belief in both the agreement and disagreement label. For our system's prediction, we convert the belief in the disagreement label into a normalized probability. Consequently, predicted values range from 0 to 1 with lower values reflecting greater likelihood for crowd agreement."", 'Fig. 6: We propose a novel application of predicting the number of redundant answers to collect from the crowd per visual question to efficiently capture the diversity of all answers for all visual questions.

But the frequencies and contribution of hypernyms into the topic of the document are not changed.

It was supposed that if expressions from the same similarity set co-occur in the same document then their contribution into the document\'s topics is really more than it is presented with their frequencies, therefore their frequencies should be increased.

            Answer:
            
            The model used is the recurrent neural network (RNN) which contains a memory cell that keeps track of the information flowing through the network. This memory cell allows the RNN to learn continuous representations of the input data. The RNN can be trained end-to-end by minimizing a loss function such as cross-entropy.

These templates consist of a transcription of the predicate in the KB (e.g. performsActivity $\\Rightarrow $ how to) and placeholders for the subject (#X#) and the object (#Y#). A seed question set is then generated by applying the templates on the KB. The seed question set is further expanded through a search engine (e.g., Google, Bing), by iteratively forming each generated question as a search query to retrieve more related question candidates. Finally a selection step is applied by estimating the fluency and domain relevance of each question candidate.', 'The only human labor in this work is the question template construction. Our system does not require a large number of templates because: (1) the iterative question expansion can produce a large number of questions even with a relatively small number of seed questions, as we see in the experiments, (2) multiple entities in the KB share the same predicates.

This notion seems to resonate with our findings showing that a number of accounts spreading fake news have already been deleted or suspended by Twitter by the time of writing. If one considers that researchers using different data have found similar results BIBREF9 , it appears that the lifetime of accounts, together with the age of the questioned viral content could be useful to identify fake news.

Table TABREF20 shows our experimental results and the previous ones on SwDA dataset. It is worth noting that BIBREF10 combined GloVeBIBREF28 and pre-trained ELMo representationsBIBREF29 as word embeddings. However, in our work, we only applied the pre-trained word embedding. To illustrate the importance of context information, we also evaluate several sentence classification methods (CNN, LSTM, BERT) as baselines. For baseline models, both CNN and LSTM, got similar accuracy (75.27% and 75.59% respectively). We also fine-tuned BERT BIBREF30 to do recognition based on single utterance. As seen, with the powerful unsupervised pre-trained language model, BERT (76.88% accuracy) outperformed LSTM and CNN models for single sentence classification. However, it was still much lower than the models based on context information. It indicates that context information is crucial in the DA recognition task. BERT can boost performance in a large margin. However, it costs too much time and resources. In this reason, we chose LSTM as our utterance encoder in further experiment.', 'However, previous approaches cannot make full use of the relative position relationship between utterances. It is natural that utterances in the local context always have strong dependencies in our daily dialog. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical model based on self-attention BIBREF11 and revise the attention distribution to focus on a local and contextual semantic information by a learnable Gaussian bias which represents the relative position information between utterances, inspired by BIBREF12. Further, to analyze the effect of dialog length quantitatively, we introduce a new dialog segmentation mechanism for the DA task and evaluate the performance of different dialogue length and context padding length under online and offline settings. Experiment and visualization show that our method can learn the local contextual dependency between utterances explicitly and achieve promising performance in two well-known datasets.', 'Previous work mainly focuses on the offline setting where we can access the whole utterances in the dialogue and predict all the DA labels simultaneously. However, the online setting is the natural demand in our real-time applications. For the online setting, we only care about the recognition result of the last utterance in the given context, as seen in the area with the red dashed line in Figure FIGREF6, our model is well compatible with online setting, we can calculate the attention between the last utterance and the other utterances directly where $K \\in \\mathbb {R}^{1\\times d}, Q \\in \\mathbb {R}^{n\\times d}, V \\in \\mathbb {R}^{n\\times d}$. For LSTM, we still have to model the entire sequence, which is slower than attention based models. Table TABREF17 shows the time complexity comparison excluding the time cost of first layer encoding, and the dialogue length $n$ is smaller than the representation dimension $d$. Our model is easy to expand into the online setting, however, to have a fair comparison with previous work, in our experiments, we applied the models under the offline setting by default.', 'Table 4: Comparison results with the previous approaches and our approaches on SwDA dataset.', 'where $embed$ represents the embedding layer which can be initialized by pre-trained embeddings. To make a fair comparison with previous work, we do not use the fine-grained embedding presented in BIBREF21. LSTM helps us get the context-aware sentence representation for the input sequence. There are several approaches to represent the sentence from the words. Following BIBREF22, we add a max-pooling layer after LSTM, which selects the maximum value in each dimension from the hidden units.

Our global greedy parser significantly outperforms the easy-first parser in BIBREF14 (HT-LSTM) on both PTB and CTB. Compared with other graph- and transition-based parsers, our model is also competitive with the state-of-the-art on PTB when considering the UAS metric. Compared to state-of-the-art parsers in transition and graph types, BIAF and STACKPTR, respectively, our model gives better or comparable results but with much faster training and decoding. Additionally, with the help of pre-trained language models, ELMo or BERT, our model can achieve even greater results.', 'In this paper, we propose a novel Global (featuring) Greedy (inference) parsing architecture that achieves fast training, high decoding speed and good performance. With our approach, we use the one-shot arc scoring scheme as in the graph-based parser instead of the stepwise local scoring in transition-based. This is essential for achieving competitive performance, efficient training, and fast decoding. Since, to preserve linear time decoding, we chose a greedy algorithm, we introduce a parsing order scoring scheme to retain the decoding order in inference to achieve the highest accuracy possible. Just as with one-shot scoring in graph-based parsers, our proposed parser will perform arc-attachment scoring, parsing order scoring, and decoding simultaneously in an incremental, deterministic fashion just as transition-based parsers do.', 'The number of decoding steps to build a parse tree for a sentence is the same as its length, $n$. Combining this with the searching in the pending list (at each step, we need to find the highest-scoring pair in the pending list to attach. This has a runtime of $O(n)$. The time complexity of a full decoding is $O(n^2)$, which is equal to 1st-order non-projective graph-based parsing but more efficient than 1st-order projective parsing with $O(n^3)$ and other higher order graph parsing models. Compared with the current state-of-the-art transition-based parser STACKPTR BIBREF23, with the same decoding time complexity as ours, since our number of decoding takes $n$ steps while STACKPTR takes $2n-1$ steps for decoding and needs to compute the attention vector at each step, our model actually would be much faster than STACKPTR in decoding.', 'The easy-first parsing approach BIBREF14, BIBREF15 was designed to integrate the advantages of graph-based parsers’ better-performing trees and transition-based parsers’ linear decoding complexity. By processing the input tokens in a stepwise easy-to-hard order, the algorithm makes use of structured information on partially-built parse trees. Because of the presence of rich, structured information, exhaustive inference is not an optimal solution - we can leverage this information to conduct inference much more quickly. As an alternative to exhaustive inference, easy-first chooses to use an approximated greedy search that only explores a tiny fraction of the search space. Compared to graph-based parsers, however, easy-first parsers have two apparent weaknesses: slower training and worse performance.

Experimental results verify that Conversational-GCN can handle deep conversation structures effectively, and our hierarchical framework performs much better than existing methods. In future work, we shall explore to incorporate external context BIBREF16, BIBREF50, and extend our model to multi-lingual scenarios BIBREF51. Moreover, we shall investigate the diffusion process of rumors from social science perspective BIBREF52, draw deeper insights from there and try to incorporate them into the model design.', ""Especially, our method shows the effectiveness of determining $denying$ stance, while other methods can not give any correct prediction for $denying$ class (the $F_{\\text{D}}$ scores of them are equal to zero). Further, Conversational-GCN also achieves higher $F_1$ score for $querying$ stance ($F_{\\text{Q}}$). Identifying $denying$ and $querying$ stances correctly is crucial for veracity prediction because they play the role of indicators for $false$ and $unverified$ rumors respectively (see Figure FIGREF2). Meanwhile, the class-imbalanced problem of data makes this a challenge. Conversational-GCN effectively encodes structural context for each tweet via aggregating information from its neighbors, learning powerful stance features without feature engineering. It is also more computationally efficient than sequential and temporal based methods. The information aggregations for all tweets in a conversation are worked in parallel and thus the running time is not sensitive to conversation's depth."", 'Comparisons among multi-task methods show that two joint methods outperform the pipeline method (BranchLSTM+NileTMRG), indicating that jointly learning two tasks can improve the generalization through leveraging the interrelation between them. Further, compared with MTL2 which uses a “parallel” architecture to make predictions for two tasks, our Hierarchical-PSV performs better than MTL2. The hierarchical architecture is more effective to tackle the joint predictions of rumor stance and veracity, because it not only possesses the advantage of parameter-sharing but also offers deep integration of the feature representation learning process for the two tasks.

The SSEC corpus is an annotation of the SemEval 2016 Task 6 corpus with emotion labels. The re-annotation of the SemEval 2016 Task 6 corpus helps to bridge the gap between the unavailability of a corpus with sentiment and emotion labels. The SemEval 2016 corpus contains tweets which are classified into positive, negative or other. It contains 2,914 training and 1,956 test instances. The SSEC corpus is annotated with anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust labels. Each tweet could belong to one or more emotion classes and one sentiment class. Table TABREF15 shows the data statistics of SemEval 2016 task 6 and SSEC which are used for sentiment and emotion analysis, respectively.', 'A survey of related literature reveals the use of both classical and deep-learning approaches for sentiment and emotion analysis. The system proposed in BIBREF8 relied on supervised statistical text classification which leveraged a variety of surface form, semantic, and sentiment features for short informal texts. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) based system for sentiment analysis was used in BIBREF9, whereas an ensemble of four different sub-systems for sentiment analysis was proposed in BIBREF10. It comprised of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) BIBREF11, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) BIBREF12, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) BIBREF13 and Support Vector Regression (SVR) BIBREF14. BIBREF15 reported the results for emotion analysis using SVR, LSTM, CNN and Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) BIBREF16. BIBREF17 proposed a lexicon based feature extraction for emotion text classification. A rule-based approach was adopted by BIBREF18 to extract emotion-specific semantics. BIBREF19 used a high-order Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for emotion detection. BIBREF20 explored deep learning techniques for end-to-end trainable emotion recognition. BIBREF21 proposed a multi-task learning model for fine-grained sentiment analysis. They used ternary sentiment classification (negative, neutral, positive) as an auxiliary task for fine-grained sentiment analysis (very-negative, negative, neutral, positive, very-positive). A CNN based system was proposed by BIBREF22 for three phase joint multi-task training. BIBREF23 presented a multi-task learning based model for joint sentiment analysis and semantic embedding learning tasks. BIBREF24 proposed a multi-task setting for emotion analysis based on a vector-valued Gaussian Process (GP) approach known as coregionalisation BIBREF25. A hierarchical document classification system based on sentence and document representation was proposed by BIBREF26. An attention framework for sentiment regression is described in BIBREF27. BIBREF28 proposed a DeepEmoji system based on transfer learning for sentiment, emotion and sarcasm detection through emoji prediction. However, the DeepEmoji system treats these independently, one at a time.', 'Experimental results indicate that the multi-task system which uses fine-grained information of emotion analysis helps to boost the performance of sentiment analysis. The system M1 comprises of the system S1 performing the main task (sentiment analysis) with E1 undertaking the auxiliary task (emotion analysis). Similarly, the system M2 is made up of S2 and E2 where S2 performs the main task (sentiment analysis) and E2 commits to the auxiliary task (emotion analysis). We observe that in both the situations, the auxiliary task, i.e. emotional information increases the performance of the main task, i.e. sentiment analysis when these two are jointly performed. Experimental results help us to establish the fact that emotion analysis benefits sentiment analysis. The implicit sentiment attached to the emotion words assists the multi-task system. Emotion such as joy and trust are inherently associated with a positive sentiment whereas, anger, disgust, fear and sadness bear a negative sentiment. Figure FIGREF21 illustrates the performance of various models for sentiment analysis.', 'In this paper, we have presented a novel two-layered multi-task attention based neural network which performs sentiment analysis through emotion analysis. The primary attention mechanism of the two-layered multi-task system relies on Distributional Thesaurus which acts as a source of external knowledge. The system hierarchically builds the final representation from the word level to the sentence level. This provides a working insight to the system and its ability to handle the unseen words. Evaluation on the benchmark dataset suggests an improvement of 3.2 F-score point for sentiment analysis and an overall performance boost of 5 F-score points for emotion analysis over the existing state-of-the-art systems. The system empirically establishes the fact that emotion analysis is both useful and relevant to sentiment analysis. The proposed system does not rely on any language dependent features or lexicons. This makes it extensible to other languages as well. In future, we would like to extend the two-layered multi-task attention based neural network to other languages.', 'We compare the performance of our proposed system with the state-of-the-art systems of SemEval 2016 Task 6 and the systems of BIBREF15.

            My paper passages:
            The good performance of recurrent network methods is hardly a surprise, given observed effectiveness of neural networks in many NLP tasks in the recent decade. It seems that bidirectional LSTM augmented with ELMo may already hit the limit for correcting Polish spelling errors without contextual information. While it improves accuracy in comparison to LSTM initialized withrandom noise, it makes the test cross-entropy slightly worse, which hints at overfitting. The perplexity measures actually increase sharply for more sophisticated architectures. Perplexity should show how little probability is assigned by the model to true answers. We measure it as INLINEFORM0 
            On the other hand, the vector distance method was able to bring a discernible improvement over pure Levenshtein distance, comparable even with the most basic LSTM. It is possible that assigning more fine-tuned weights to edit distance and semantic distance would make the quality of predictions even higher. The idea of using vector space measurements explicitly can be also expanded if we were to consider the problem of contextualizing corrections. For example, the semantic distance","['1905.10810-Conclusion-0', '1905.10810-Results-2', '1905.10810-Results-1', '1905.10810-Recurrent neural networks-2', '1905.10810-Recurrent neural networks-3']","['Among the methods tested the bidirectional LSTM, especially initialized by ELMo embeddings, offers the best accuracy and raw performance. Adding ELMo to a straightforward PyTorch implementation of LSTM may be easier now than at the time of performing our tests, as since then the authors of ELMoForManyLangs package BIBREF19 improved their programmatic interface. However, if a more interpretable and explainable output is required, some version of vector distance combined with edit distance may be the best direction. It should be noted that this method produces multiple candidate corrections with their similarity scores, as opposed to only one “best guess“ correction that can be obtained from a character-based LSTM. This is important in applications where it is up to humans to the make the final decision, and they are only to be aided by a machine.', 'The good performance of recurrent network methods is hardly a surprise, given observed effectiveness of neural networks in many NLP tasks in the recent decade.

The idea of using vector space measurements explicitly can be also expanded if we were to consider the problem of contextualizing corrections. For example, the semantic distance of proposed corrections to the nearest words is likely to carry much information about their appropriateness. Looking from another angle, searching for words that seem semantically off in context may be a good heuristic for detecting errors that are not nonword (that is, they lead to wrong forms appearing in text which are nevertheless in-vocabulary).', 'In order to provide the network an additional, broad picture peek at the whole error form we also evaluated a setup where the internal state of LSTM cells, instead of being initialized randomly, is computed from an ELMo embedding BIBREF18 of the token. The ELMo embedder is capable of integrating linguistic information carried by the whole form (probably often not much in case of errors), as well as the string as a character chain. The latter is processed with a convolutional neural network. How this representation is constructed is informed by the whole corpus on which the embedder was trained. The pretrained ELMo model that we used BIBREF19 was trained on Wikipedia and Common Crawl corpora of Polish.', 'The ELMo embedding network outputs three layers as matrices, which are supposed to reflect subsequent compositional layers of language, from phonetic phenomena at the bottom to lexical ones at the top.

    First, attention loss is different from alignment loss because of the different loss functions for the two losses. 

    For attention loss, the model outputs the probability of the correct word for each word class. 

    While for alignment loss, the model outputs the probability of aligning each word to the target word.

    Second, attention loss and alignment loss are different because of the different alignment algorithms.

    Attention loss uses a heuristic alignment algorithm, while alignment loss uses a statistical alignment algorithm.

    The heuristic algorithm aligns words when they are in the same POS tag, while the statistical algorithm aligns words when they are near each other.

    Third, attention loss and alignment loss are different because of the different training objectives.

    The attention loss is trained to predict the correct POS tag for each word, while the alignment loss is trained to align each word to the target word.

    In short, attention loss and alignment loss are different because of the different loss functions, alignment algorithms, and training objectives.

It is only when the dataset becomes large or when the words are noisy and non-standardized with misspellings, text emoticons and short-forms that deep learning models which learns the sentence-level semantics start to outperform BoW representation, because under such circumstances, BoW representation can become extremely sparse and the vocabulary size can become huge. It becomes clear that for large, complex data, a large deep learning model with a large capacity can extract a better sentence-level representation than BoW sentence representation. However, for small and standardized news-like dataset, a direct word counting TF-IDF sentence representation is superior. Then the question is can we design a deep learning model that performs well for both simple and complex, small and large datasets? And when the dataset is small and standardized, the deep learning model should perform comparatively well as BoW? With that problem in mind, we designed TDSM (Top-Down-Semantic-Model) which learns a sentence representation that carries the information of both the BoW-like representation and RNN style of sentence-level semantic which performs well for both simple and complex, small and large datasets.""]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.2202643171806167,0.2710076859996385,100.00000000000004,0.05333333333333333,0.5917677800883594,1.0,"1. is the standard word counting method whereby the feature vector represents the term frequency of the words in a sentence.

    ... To develop a faster model, we tried to use sparse vectors, which occupy less storage space and are more efficient for computing. For example, we used the sparse representation (SPARSE) of word embeddings. We trained a word2vec model using the SPARSE representation of the 300-dimensional vector space of word embeddings, and the dimensionality of the feature vectors at the input layer was reduced to 100. We also used the SPARSE representation of the 100-dimensional vector space of character embeddings, and the dimensionality of the feature vectors at the input layer was also reduced to 50.

    Question: What is the recommended way to use BERT? Sentence Embeddings or Contextualized Representations?

    Paper passages:
    BERT can be used in two settings. In the first setting, called sentence-level BERT, the model is applied to the input sentence as a whole. In the second setting, called contextualized BERT, the model is applied to each token in the sentence conditioned on the previous tokens.

    Answer:
    Contextualized Representations.

On the social media datasets, AEM outpoerforms both LEM and DPEMM by 6.5% and 1.7% respectively in F-measure on the FSD dataset, and 4.4% and 3.7% in F-measure on the Twitter dataset. We can also observe that apart from K-means, all the approaches perform worse on the Twitter dataset compared to FSD, possibly due to the limited size of the Twitter dataset. Moreover, on the Google dataset, the proposed AEM performs significantly better than LEM and DPEMM. It improves upon LEM by 15.5% and upon DPEMM by more than 30% in F-measure. This is because: (1) the assumption made by LEM and DPEMM that all words in a document are generated from a single event is not suitable for long text such as news articles; (2) DPEMM generates too many irrelevant events which leads to a very low precision score.

The learned generator captures event-related patterns rather than generating text sequence; (2) Different from LEM and DPEMM, AEM uses a generator network to capture the event-related patterns and is able to mine events from different text sources (short and long).

            Low dimensional word representations (embeddings) have become a key component in modern NLP systems for language modeling, parsing, sentiment classification, and many others.
